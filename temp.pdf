JAN 2024 | FY23 OP2 – FSI 
Amazon Confidential  Page 1 of 12 The purpose of this document is to give the reader an overview of the Financial Services business in India, some context around the 1 India nuances, key macro factors that are driving behaviour around cloud adoption, plans for FY24 and our big bets. 2 Vision: FSI vision is to be the ‘Transformation Partner’ of choice for the FSI Industry and a catalyst for cultural transformation and 3 Innovation. We want to be the largest CSP (primary/ preferred cloud provider) for the top 10 customers in Banking, Insurance, 4 Capital Markets and NBFC. Currently, we are meaningfully engaged at 7/10 Private sector banks (largest CSP at 4), top 9 insurers 5 (both life and non-life insurance companies, largest at 7) and 14 of 16 non-banking financial companies. We plan to enable Fintechs 6 to become the preferred rails for "Digital Public Infrastructure", while increasing our wallet share further to 85%+, from the current 7 79%. In the next 5 years, we aspire to build this into a $1B business. 8 1.0 Business Overview: 9 1.1 Historical trends, TAS, view of Greenfield, Net new vs. Recurring: 10 Financial Services segment covers ~$3B in TAS. Banking sub-segment is 11 by-far the largest with low penetration, which gives a significant 12 runway for growth, with the right regulatory conditions. 11% of these 13 accounts are Greenfield, representing 20% of the TAS. A big percentage 14 of this is in Public Sector Banks. The adjacent table gives a breakdown 15 of accounts covered in each segment, the associated GAR and TAS. A 16 deeper strategy to grow this segment is covered in our Think Big Plan. 17 Note: TAS data used for segmentation has data errors (e.g. Web3 applications, which represent Crypto, GAR is more than TAS). For the sake of consistency, we have used the same data 18 used for segmentation. Directionally, the spread of TAS and the overall numbers are realistic and should give a good idea of the industry. 19 1.2 Headwinds/ Tailwinds: 20 There are significant tailwinds in Banking, where rapid growth in digital payments and adoption of digital channels (post Covid) is 21 driving digital transformation projects across the industry. This largely drove the Fintech growth over the last few years, helped by 22 the exponential growth in UPI (digital B2C and C2C/P2P payments). UPI volume in Dec 2023 touched $208B (11.4B transactions). 23 UPI volume has grown at a CAGR of 168% from 2017-18 from $12B to $1.7T. Banks are increasingly looking at Cloud-first strategies 24 to drive Innovation as well as build resiliency and scalability for highly volatile workloads like payments. Indian FS market is still 25 largely underserved (only ~70% of Indians have Bank accts, with credit & insurance at <10% penetration), which provides a large 26 runway for growth for FS industry in India, beyond the current TAS. Large Private sector FS players are investing in modernizing 27 platforms to plan capacity for future growth driven by favourable demographics, and increasingly looking at cloud-native 28 architectures to drive business agility or lower costs (E.g.: Postgres is becoming the first choice over Oracle for CX workloads). Banks 29 are investing in in-house build capabilities esp. for Digital platforms, which positions AWS favourably due to our developer & startup 30 ecosystem in India. There are a few headwinds that might slow down revenue growth that are 31 largely uncontrollable. 1/ Cost. There is an intense focus on Cost Optimization as customers try to 32 put more governance on cloud costs. Cheap labour costs and favourable on-prem pricing is not 33 enabling a significant price differential in the early stages of the cloud journey. Traditional and 34 new players, like Adani and Jio, are coming up with competitive price-points for FS customers to 35 continue investing on-prem. 2/ Geo-political/ Regulatory uncertainty. Inconsistent policies (E.g. 36 Central Banking Digital Currency not allowed to go on public cloud; SEBI, Securities Regulator, has been sending mixed messages in 37 private conversations with regulated entities on moving critical workloads to public cloud) have created ambiguity and hence 38 cautiousness in any rapid movement to the cloud. RBI (Banking regulator) has also recently indicated an intent to offer its own cloud 39 facility for hosting critical workloads. Geo-political risks and an implicit nudge for an India cloud (owned/operated by an Indian 40 company) option is increasing complexity. NBFCs have also come under intense regulatory scrutiny and have been restricted to 41 grow some aspects (like lending). 3/ FX volatility is driving demand for INR pricing. 4/ Funding winter is expected to continue for 42 most of 2024. 2023 saw a precipitous drop in funding from $9.6B in 2021, $6B in 2022 to $2.1B in 2023 (Source: Tracxn), leading to 43 muted growth expectation of Fintech revenue in 2024. Crypto industry is also on the decline owing to regulatory ambiguity (Crypto 44 customers have already reduced usage by an avg. 12% in 2023). 5/ Increase in competitive activity, who are trying to reduce the 45 gap with aggressive pricing options, and INR pricing. Most Indian FSIs are India-focused and don’t have a large multinational 46 engagement. They don’t have a FX risk from their core business and do not want that to be introduced because of their IT spend. 47 1.3 Cloud/customer/segment maturity  48 Banks will continue to provide the largest runway for growth (45% of FSI TAS, 4% wallet share in terms of GAR), as seen in section 49 1.1. The journey started in 2020 and only private sector banks have begun their move to the cloud over the last 3 years. Public 50 Sector Banks (~$700M+ TAS) are poised to begin their journey this year and will be a Think Big bet for driving FS growth. Most 51 private sector insurers (e.g. ICICI Lombard, HDFC Life, BAGIC) and Capital Markets (e.g. Angel One, Motilal Oswal, HDFC AMC) 52 entities have moved most workloads to the cloud through Lift+Shift migrations. Modernization and migration of core systems, 53 Innovation, Data modernization, Gen AI will be key focus in these sectors. Private sector banks continue to be large buyers of ISV 54 solutions but are also starting to transform themselves into builders (e.g. HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, Kotak Bank), starting with CX and 55 Sub-Segment# AccountsTTM GAR$TASGAR % TASBanking53$56,276,852$1,302,471,8444%NBFC31$14,596,645$534,057,5403%Insurance41$35,987,140$450,006,8998%Payments64$200,910,108$356,767,63456%Capital Markets/Securities55$53,861,145$243,787,84822%Financial Services - Other13$6,983,625$17,955,57739%Web3 Apps (Crypto)5$18,408,776$17,560,996105%Software2$956,871$1,588,17060%Grand Total264$387,981,163$2,924,196,50813%

Amazon Confidential  Page 2 of 12 Digital Banking platforms. Fintech customers are largely all-in and the most mature cloud customers. Growth here will depend on 56 the growth of the Fintech sector. They are builders who are driving Innovation through technology.  57 1.4 Market segment positioning / Noteworthy 2023 progress/successes 58 2023 was a year of many firsts including large PPA’s with 2 of the Top 3 private sector Banks (HDFC Bank: $80M/5Y; Axis Bank: 59 $90M/5Y– largest for any CSP in India Enterprise FSI); Large SRRP deals with Zscaler at HDFC Bank (TCV: $40M/5Y) and ICICI Bank 60 (TCV: $62M/6Y), first Salesforce SRRP deal in AWS India at HDFC Bank, Deployment of secondary envt of CRMNext at Axis Bank. We 61 also saw acceleration of modernization of core workloads (e.g. TCS BaNCS Policy Administration System at SBI  GIC, and core digital 62 platforms like Optimus, Mobile+ Net banking, at IDFC First Bank, Thought Machine, Core Banking for new digital products, at IDFC 63 First and PayU). In Analytics, Amazon Redshift became a platform of choice at Angel One, Kotak Bank and Motilal Oswal. With 64 Fintech customers, there was significant progress around  1/ Graviton adoption (improved from ~5.5% in Jan-23 to 8.9% in Nov-23) 65 2/ Improved PPA  Coverage from 79%  to 86% of 2023 revenue; 24 (out of 52) customers under PPA. Wins: PayU ($60M/3Y), 66 Razorpay ($50M/3Y), Navi ($20M/5Y), and Bharatpe ($18M/3Y); 3/ Enterprise Support Penetration: 16 (out of top 20) on ES with 3 67 net-new wins in 2023. YTD Nov, strategic services adoption by Fintechs have grown 17% (~$54M in 2022 to ~$63M in 2023).   68 1.5 What is the 3Y/5Y vision? What will you be doing in 2024 to get closer to that vision? 69 We aspire to grow the FSI business to $1B in 5 years. Beyond the BAU Sales plays, we will continue to focus on the FSI Industry 70 Solutions IGA to drive business outcomes on AWS; deepen our Fintech engagement, increasing our wallet share by driving more 71 Pan-Amazon synergies and hence stickiness to AWS; making big bets around Public Sector Banks ($700M+ TAS) and 72 transformational DC Exits in a few large Private Sector banks, to drive significant growth in 3-5 years. Details in Think Big section.  73 2.0 FY23 Summary, observations, and learnings 74 2.1 Overall performance - vertical/segment 75 As highlighted in section 1.2, the 76 Banking segment is driving a healthy 77 growth ($53M, 68% Nov’23 YTD, YoY) 78 as the largest private sector banks 79 adopt a cloud first strategy to drive 80 Innovation, deliver better CX. Banks 81 have taken a measured approach to cloud adoption and have not embarked on large lift and shift initiatives. Instead, they are taking 82 a modernization approach to determine which applications need to be moved to the cloud. As applications have gotten complex 83 (like CRM, Loan management systems), the project and sales life cycles have increased (by 14-16%), leading to a slower growth rate 84 than years past (where growth was driven by non-critical applications). Public Sector Banks have just begun to consider cloud for 85 some of their transformation initiatives. We won the first few opportunities (CRMNext at Punjab National Bank, $3M/5Y) and Union 86 Bank of India ($600K ARR) that will begin their deployment journey in 2024. Insurance continues to have mixed growth ($28M, 17% 87 Nov’23 YTD, YoY) with some large accounts HDFC Life ($4.7M , -5% Nov’23 YTD YoY), BAGIC+BALIC ($2.65M, 14% Nov’23 YTD YoY), 88 ICICI Pru Life ($2.2M, 4% Nov’23 YTD YoY), in the final stages of their migrations. The current growth is being driven by core 89 modernization and data initiatives at Acko General Insurance ($2.1M, 86% Nov’23 YTD YoY), Max Life ($2.2M, 27% Nov’23 YTD YoY), 90 Star Health, ($1.3M, 52% Nov’23 YTD YoY). Capital Markets (50% YoY), with seen strong growth in 6 of the top 8 accounts, driven 91 by new app development and data initiatives at Angel Broking ($7M, 61% Nov’23 YTD YoY), DC Exit at HDFC AMC ($1.1M , 336% 92 Nov’23 YTD YoY). Fintech overall has slowed down due to the funding winter, as evidenced in section 1.2. E.g.: Razorpay (Usage -93 10% YoY), Cred ( -8%), Upstox (-19%), Simpl (-17%). However, the trends are mixed with sectors like Capital Markets (Quadeye: 94 +112%, Zerodha-32%), Digital Lending (Navi:+183%, Truebalance:+147%), and Insurtech (Acko:+77% Policy Bazar:+32%) have seen 95 growth while others like Crypto (Industry:-21%), and Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL, Slice:- 17%) have declined. Fintech customers like 96 Quadeye grew by entering new markets; Payments startups were focused on cross/upselling to their existing customers. E.g.: Navi 97 entered into insurance, mutual funds & wealth management and Zerodha diversified into fund management. Paytm growth was 98 also aided by consolidation of workloads on to AWS (~$10M ARR), from regions outside India. Apart from shutting down non-99 profitable business, Fintechs have also taken hard measures such as RIF(Reductions in workforce) e.g.: Cred (35%), PayU (6%), 100 Polygon (20%), CoinDCX (25%) to increase the runway in their business.  101 2.2 Key callouts on team structure, tenure, culture, diversity, connections scores, hiring, RA/URA 102 The FS team comprises of 38 resources (35 BIS), which includes 3 FLMs (tenure ranging from 6-10 years at 103 Amazon); 33 ICs (30 BIS, 3 Women); 1 FSI ISV BD and 1 Program Manager. 39% of the team is less than 2 years 104 at Amazon, while 42% of the team is over 4 years at Amazon, making it a healthy mix of relatively new and 105 tenured Amazonians. Diversity Ratio needs to be improved and we will be intentional in the hiring of TBHs. There 106 are also 2 employees currently on Pivot and 1 employee (RA) serving a notice period. All managers are new to 107 their teams and connection score are not available, right now, that reflects the sentiment of the new org. FSI org 108 has 4 L5s, 24 L6s and 7 L7s, apart from 3 L7Ms as FLMs. The 3 FLMs have 9 (ENT FSI Focus), 10 (Fintech) and 13 (ENT FSI Deep) as 109 span of controls. FSI Segment leader will have 6 people reporting directly as outlined at the beginning of this section, with the 110 addition of the AM for SBI, who will report directly for span of control purposes.

We have been intentional about our team’s wellbeing/development and 112 executing it through 3 pillars 1/FSI Weekly Connect: We bring the FSI sellers together every week to collaborate with functional 113 teams like Partner, ProServe, Training, Marketing team etc. to make our FSI customer successful in their cloud journey. 2/FSI 114 Falcons: FSI AMs, SAs and BDSI teams come together monthly to learn and share insights on new use cases deployed, customer 115 innovations, Progress made with our FSI customers and go deep with some of marquee wins and solutions to make it a repeatable. 116 We will continue both of these engagements in FY24. 3/Upskilling and Career Development: We initiated the ENT Enablement 117 Friday series in 2023 to upskill/enable our team on themes like FSI Specific solutions/ offerings, Industry Specific solutions, Strategic 118 Services, Executive Engagement and Sales Skills sessions led by FE and Industry teams. In FY24, we will plan 20 such enablement 119 workshops and drive programs like FSI/Fintech Ready Program GenAI Refresher Program, Growth Mindset Program. FSI Path’shala’ 120 is a monthly enablement mechanism where we invite strategic ISVs to present their FSI Industry Solutions and USPs. Objective is to 121 equip AWS account teams with functional understanding of the solution and be able to make an initial pitch to FSI customers. Last 122 year we conducted 15 FSI Path'shala sessions and this year we plan to conduct 20. 123 2.3 Successes / performance outcomes against strategy (strategic services) 124 Migrations, Data/ Analytics/ AIML, ISV solutions were key sales plays in 2023. ISV progress is covered in the IGA update. Migrations 125 continue to work well, driving good growth in ENT FSI. Against a 2023 stretch target of $36M migration ARR, we have closed 21 126 (30% of ENT) MAPs with a migration ARR of $51.4M (143% of stretch target). Major migration wins have been from Insurance ( 6 127 out of 21 wins) and Banks (9 out of 21 wins) and rest from NBFC (4, including 1 from Bajaj Finance Ltd, Microsoft’s largest NBFC 128 account), Capital markets(2). In the Fintech space, we have identified 5 Migration prospects (Phone pay, Billdesk, Paisa Bazaar, 129 Wimbo, CC Avenue)  with $25M TAS in our cohort where we plan to close min 2 MAP wins ($3M) in 2024 and acquire all 5 customers 130 ($20M) by FY26. The FSI AI/ML revenue grew by 16% ($1.85M, Nov’23 YTD), driven by 27% growth in the Fintech segment ($785K 131 Nov’23 YTD), led by Paytm ($380K Nov’23 YTD, 100% YoY). The FSI Ent segment grew at 10%($1.3M Nov’23 YTD) owing to degrowth 132 in IDFC First Bank (Nov YTD, $572K, -17% YoY, owing to EDP and Sagemaker Savings plan discounts) and RBL Bank ($90K Nov’23 133 YTD, -52% YoY, due to reduced experimentation and stopping usage of Transcribe). The Analytics revenue grew by 25% ($17.8M, 134 Nov’23 YTD), driven by a 76% growth in FSI Ent segment ($7M, Nov’23 YTD) led by Angel Broking ($1.1M, Nov’23 YTD, 313% YTD, 135 YoY). 2023 saw a healthy 75% Partner attach rate for the Ent FSI segment, up from 70% in 2022, led by collaboration with GSI’s like 136 Deloitte (Indusind Bank, Axis Bank), Accenture (AU Small Finance Bank), TCS (Max Life). In FY’23 YTD (till Oct’23), strategic services 137 contribution to Fintech accounts contribution has increased by 9% (2023 YTD at $51.5M vs FY22 YTD at $47.5M); Database is at 138 $24.7M 2023 YTD, 10% YoY, Containers  at $17.5M 2023 YTD, 14% YoY, Analytics at $8.67M 2023 YTD, -4% YoY and AI/ML is at 139 $0.61M 2023 YTD, 24% YoY. Details in Appendix 4. Gen AI update in Appendix 5. 140 3.0 FY24 execution plan and initiatives 141 Bottoms-up optimistic projections for 2024, 142 submitted by the team in late Nov, was 143 translating to a 13% YoY growth rate (29% for 144 ENT FSI and 3% for Fintech). We have since 145 reworked our forecasts, identified 146 opportunities, worked on pipeline targets for a 147 Fast start (see Appendix 2), factored early outcomes of some Big Bets (FSI ISV, PSB) which now translates to a 22% YoY growth rate 148 (40% ENT FSI and 10% Fintech), which is significantly better than the Nov Forecasts, but still carries risk in Fintech Forecast, 149 especially. We are identifying a PTG for the remaining gap over the next few weeks. In summary, we continue to expect growth in 150 the Banking and Capital Markets verticals. Insurance will be muted but will grow at a moderate pace. There is limited baseline 151 erosion in Enterprise FSI accounts (E.g. NSE $2.55M, RBL $1.57M) but there are headwinds in Fintech. In Fintech, Quadeye (Entered 152 new markets, and crypto) and Paytm (consolidation from other regions to India) had one-time events in 2023 that will not recur in 153 FY24. We expect our big bets to start paying dividends in FY25 and beyond and are confident of reaching $1B in 5Y. 154 Revenue Concentration: Top 19% (32 out of 171) of 155 the accounts, when viewed at a parent level, drive 80% 156 of FSI Revenue. At the child level, this translates to Top 157 17% of the 264 accounts driving 80% of the revenue. 158 However, the long tail of FSI is growing at a much faster 159 rate than the top accounts, which should help reduce concentration. 160 3.1 Sales motion implementation and verticalization 161 Sales Motions: The FSI Deep (ENT) segment ($66M YTD Nov’23), comprises 13 Banks (~$1B TAS, 7 PSU, 6 Private Sector Banks) 162 including subsidiaries and 1 large NBFC group (Bajaj Finserv) and will be addressed with 14 AMs (12 BIS, 1 open HC, 1 to be raised), 163 and 14 SAs. To drive optimal coverage, accounts >500K ARR will have 1:1 AM to account coverage ratio, with 5 Greenfield PSU Banks 164 at 1:2.5 coverage ratio. The key pillars of our GTM will include: 1/ Influence the cultural transformation of the largest FSIs in India: 165 To become the innovation partner of their choice by positively influencing their culture, we will invest in long term executive 166 relationships with CXOs (aligning exec sponsors from AWS), leverage CXO engagement mechanisms such as COI/WB to help them 167

Our investment in CSMs coupled with ES will help us accelerate execution 3/ CX and Digital 172 Banking: To harness a key trend of these large Banks investing in in-house builders to esp. build CX & digital platforms, our focus 173 on T&C, Account Based Marketing & enablement (to be detailed in an account plan) will help us build skills and nurture AWS 174 champions across the breadth of their organization. 4/ Public Sector Banks: Within the PSU Bank space, we have begun to make 175 headway with the creation of a dedicated landing zone at State Bank of India (India’s largest Bank), CRMNext win(5Y/$3M) at Punjab 176 National Bank(3rd largest PSU) and Cloud transformation VMCA win at Union Bank of India($600K ARR). For 2024, unlocking PSBs 177 is a big bet, the plan for which is elaborated in our Think Big plan. 178 FSI Focus (ENT) consists of 118 accounts (child a/cs) spread across 9 territories (with 1 dedicated GRN territory with ~24 accounts) 179 with $59M TTM revenue, spread across sub-industries as 44 banking (or lending/NBFCs), 21 capital market cos, 18 insurers and rest 180 as other misc. financial services providers. The average coverage ratio in engaged territories is 1:11 in ENG and 1:24 in GRN. The 181 territories are regionally spread as Mumbai (5), Chennai (1), BLR (1) and Delhi (1) with an optimal mix of Focus core and select 182 accounts. One territory in Mumbai is predominantly focused on Capital Markets, while the rest are a mixed across sub verticals. FSI 183 Focus sales motion will help customer drive their transformation goals by 1/ Driving industry specific solutions, esp. with LOB 184 stakeholders across Digital banking, lending solutions, CX, risk management, underwriting, claims, analytics, etc. These solutions 185 will be tailored with partners (SIs/GSIs) or vertical ISVs driving a co-sell motion or migrating/upgrading solutions from on-prem to 186 cloud. 2/ Migrations and modernization will continue to be a focus to win new tactical workloads or establish a long-term cloud 187 roadmap to eventually drive DC exit opportunities; 3/ Partners: Align with specific partners (SI/GSIs –atleast 2 per customer) 188 captured in a territory plan (to be completed before Mar 1st) and driven by PSMs for proactive interlock and cadence. 4/ Marketing 189 & Innovation Programs: Leverage FS industry specific marketing programs (3rd party Industry events, ExecLeaders, FS Symposium 190 & roundtables) to drive net new contact acquisition or nurture exec relationships. To better align with cultural transformation 191 agenda of our customers, DI (both 1:1 & IXA format) will be key to help us become the preferred Innovation partner. (Appendix 7).  192 FSI Fintech business consists of 4 Deep accounts (3 from Payment and 1 from Capital Markets, with $119M TAS and $94.6M TTM 193 revenue) and the Focus cohort consists of 51 accounts (37 in Payments, 5 in Crypto, 4 Capital Markets & 5 Insurers) spread across 194 6 territories with $355M TAS and $99M TTM revenue in 2023, to be covered by 6 AMs and 5 SAs across 6 territories. 2024 Focus: 195 1/ Increase our Share of Wallet (SOW): With increased competitive activity in the last 18 months, we will continue to focus on 196 increasing our 79% share in our top 20 fintech accounts, which contribute to 86% of Fintech revenue. This year, we will target to 197 have a PPA with all Top 20 customers. We currently have 19 but 6 of them are up for renewal in 2024. (Details in Appendix 8). 2/ 198 Strengthen Executive connects: We will continue our focus to build deeper connects with our top 20 customers esp. with 199 Founder/CEO/CTO relationships through 1:1 Executive connects, AWS marketing forums for builders (Mumbai Summit, ReInvent, 200 AI Conclave etc.) and leveraging existing Marketing programs such as  the FSI Symposium. We will also leverage One Amazon 201 initiatives to drive Pan-Amazon synergies, e.g.: A.in relationships with PayU for Payment processing and Razorpay for Digital Suite 202 offerings. 3/ Operational excellence: We will complete Value maps and Account plans for top 20 customers by 15th Feb with 203 operational cadences to drive execution of the plans. Cost Optimisation will be a priority for our top customers with a goal to 204 improve the COI score from avg. of 63 to 73 by end of FY24, also increase the Graviton adoption from 8.9% to 13%. 4/ Focus on 205 next set of High Growth Accounts: We will identify the “Next 15” (from Focus) accounts & target opportunities in whitespaces. E.g. 206 Analytics/AIML opportunities in 5 of our 20 accounts that are not using AWS native services. 5 Migration prospects (PhonePe, 207 BillDesk, Paisabazaar, Wimbo, CCAvenue) and drive $3M in 2024.  208 Partner Motion: Partner attach in ENT FSI (excluding Fintechs) has grown to 75% in 2023 (vs. 70.1% in 2022). We aim to take this 209 further to 80%+ in 2024. Fintechs, who are largely builders had a partner attach of 33.2% (vs. 28% in 2022). In 2024 our partner 210 strategy will revolve around the following 4 key pillars in FSI: 1/ Proactively Partnering with GSIs to drive transformational 211 outcomes: Our engagement with GSIs has grown significantly (over 70% YoY) in 2023 for 3 out of top 5 GSIs. Overall GSI pipeline 212 grew over 137% YoY to $21.89M, reflecting both GSI interest, AWS Sellers engaging partners pro-actively and the preference from 213 customers in transformational opportunities. Some large transformational projects with GSIs in 2023 included HDFC Bank (Deloitte 214 cloud consulting), Bajaj Finserv Group (TCS), Equitas Bank (IBM, digital banking build). PSMs will own and drive Partner plans with 215 proactive interlock with key GSIs (at least 1 incumbent and 1 challenger GSI in every ENT deep and 20% of ENT Focus accounts by 216 end Q1; drive interlock with at least 1 BCAP per Deep account in H1). 2/ SI Partners for migrations & modernization: Key SI and 217 regional consulting Partners provide us scale and execution capabilities for migration & modernization with many also bringing in 218 FSI expertise on applications, process knowhow or security/regulatory compliance capabilities. We will identify 7 priority SI partners 219 (WIP: CXIO, Rackspace, ACC, Lumiq, Quadra, Ganit, Oneture) with who we will drive maximum proactive sales interlocks as well as 220 maximise 1:1 FS LT connect + cadence to build traction for better coverage. 3/ FSI ISV Partners: FSI ISV partners continue to be the 221 backbone of ENT FSIs in India, this motion elaborated in the FSI IGA section. We will also be working closely with 1/2 partners (like 222 TCS) on our Think Big opportunity to enable a DC Exit at large banks, which will require a multi-year transformational approach. 223 JAN 2024 | FY23 OP2 – FSI 
Amazon Confidential  Page 5 of 12 3.2 FSI Industry Solutions IGA Update:  224 FSI Industry solutions IGA objectives: 1/ Identify, Cultivate and Enable FSI ISVs to build cloud enabled Industry Solutions on AWS, 225 and 2/ Joint GTM of these Industry Solutions to drive value to ISV and FSI customers. 226 2023 performance vs. plan: Attainment in 2023 of $1.3M (60%). Gap in attainment due to: 1/ HDFC-CRMNext ($3M ARR) moving 227 to 2024, 2/ HDFC-Mindgate deferment ($1.7M ARR), 3/ ICICI Bank-Intellect Design moving to 2024 ($600K ARR), 4/ PNB-CRMNext 228 moving to 2024 ($600K ARR). These will provide a fast start for 2024. Another learning is the time required to align an ISV. It takes 229 3-5 months and FSI sales cycle is longer (4-6 months). Ramp time for revenue is longer than anticipated. IGA has strengthened our 230 Industry Solutions messaging to customers by bringing the entire gamut of FSI relevant partner products mapped to FSI application 231 landscape. During 2023, IGA team identified 90 ISVs, targeted 55 and connected 45 ISVs across 25+ areas (Appendix 9). Enabled 232 field teams with 14 Path’shala’ sessions, 50+ SA sessions and Joint GTM. This translated into 137 opportunities created across 67 233 unique FSI customers and 56 opportunities launched with ARR value of $4M. Key launched opportunities include CRMNext-Axis 234 Bank, Mindgate-Yes Bank, Pennant-Piramal Finance, Pennant-Avanse Finance, Decimal-AU SFB and Intellect-IDFC First. 235 2024 goals and execution plan: With Dec’23 exit MRR at $297K, we will reach an aggregate $4.9M from beginning till ’24 end. Will 236 need incremental $3.2M to meet the overall 3Y IGA target. Execution Plan to meet this: 1/ Pipeline of $7.4M in place with $1.7M in 237 Bus Val + Tech Val + Committed stage, 2/ We will execute a fast start program to accelerate closure of the opportunities in pipeline: 238 HDFC-CRMNext (first year ARR of $800K), HDFC-Mindgate (ARR $1.7M), Axis Bank-TSYS (ARR $960K), IDFC-Montran ($400K), 3/ We 239 now observe a pattern of deal replication which will support non-linear growth during 2024 e.g. CRMNext (HDFC, Axis, SBI, Canara, 240 PNB, Muthoot, JK Bank), Pennant (Piramal, Avanse, HDFC, Axis Finance, UNO Bank, Unity SFB, Ecofy, Vistaar), Mindgate (HDFC, Yes 241 Bank, IndusInd, RBL, Kotak), Liquitics (Kotak, ICICI, IndusInd, Unity SFB, Bandhan), 4/ In 2024, we will be running with 1.5 HC (1 AM 242 and 1 SA distributed between IGA and FSI accounts). Beyond revenue, IGA has a long-term impact by 1/ gaining mindshare with 243 ISVs to recommend AWS e.g. Mindgate (aligned to Azure earlier) is now AWS-First; CRMNext quoted 4 RFPs with AWS in 2023; 244 Pennant is recommending AWS as preferred partner 2/ identifying niche AWS-ready FSI industry solutions which were out of 245 purview earlier e.g. Liquitics, Coherent Global, VirSoftech, Veefin etc. 3/ entering into industry solution conversation with FSI 246 customers. Our mission is to make this the best FSI sales team in the industry, highly competent in solution-selling to our customers. 247 3.3 Q1’24 Fast Start  248 FSI in 2024, combines ENT FSI and Fintech, will focus on: 1/Account transition plan: New account team introductions and knowledge 249 transfers to be concluded by Jan 31st. 2/ Exec Connect: In order to drive deeper strategic ties and stronger account relationship we 250 will have a connect between Segment leader/ FLM and senior stakeholders of our top 30 accounts (that drive 70% of the revenue) 251 by Q1 and reach top 45 accounts that drive 80% of the revenue by end of H1. 3/ Focus on GenAI : We will explore (5th Feb- 1st Mar) 252 and execute GenAI opportunities in our Top 25 accounts with the support of our SA team with a target to pursue 15 Qualified+ 253 Opps. 4/ Team enablement: To benefit from Industry alignment model we need to train/upskill our team with relevant industry 254 knowledge/ available sales plays. We will work with Field Enablement team and Industry BD/Specialist team to roll out training 255 calendar and enablement for the year. 5/ Partner led Sales play: a/Co sell motion: Drive programmatic (19th Feb -29th Mar) co-sell 256 by focusing on five domains (Storage, Security, Analytics). b/ SRRP Prospecting campaign with 4 identified SRRP partners (PaloAlto, 257 Zscaler, MongoDb, Trendmicro) to build a SRRP pipeline in Q1’24 ($2M creation). 6/ Industry Specific Sales Plays with ISV solutions 258 (CRMNext, Penant, Mindgate) to provide solution-based offering to our customers with a target to create $5 M pipe. 259 4.0 Think Big plan: Build an integrated $1B FSI business (5X growth) by driving deeper penetration  260 Incremental revenue potential of $250M-$300M over 3Y. With rapid digitization of key infrastructure like payments and faster 261 adoption of digital channels like eBanking and Mobile, Banks have had to innovate at a faster pace than ever before to deliver 262 differentiated customer experiences and build higher resiliency on core systems. This has led Banks to embrace technology as a 263 core tenet to drive business outcomes. This has given an opportunity to explore bold DC Exit opportunities at some large banks to 264 drive deeper penetration in FSI ($200M+ ARR, $2.6B TAS across segments). FSI can be an engine of growth for India. While we will 265 continue to engage early to build cloud native solutions with Fintechs, the GTM plan for ENT FSI customers will involve a 4-pronged 266 approach focused on the highest TAS opportunities to build a $1B FSI business. 1/ Data Center (DC) exit program: Currently, only 267 about 10% of core banking/insurance workloads are on the cloud, and targeted DC exits are crucial to increase adoption. We will 268 focus on the top 16 FSI customers across banking (e.g. HDFC, ICICI, SBI, Axis, Yes Bank) & insurance (e.g. Max Life, BAGIC/BALIC, 269 ICICI Prudential Life), and target to win 60% of TAS/$100M+ ARR each, over the next 3Y-5Y (regulatory guidelines mandate a multi-270 cloud approach, thereby limiting penetration). This approach will require sustained CEO level executive engagements, tight 271 #OneAWS execution, & customized incentive programs to build early traction. We will also need to invest in a Business Development 272 team that has experience driving such large-scale DC Exits, including crafting the ideal commercial construct. 2/ Partner with leading 273 ISVs & GSIs to modernize & deploy FSI SaaS solutions: Currently, almost all traditional ENT FSIs leverage core banking applications 274 from GSIs/ISVs (e.g. TCS BaNCS, Infosys/ Finacle, Oracle FlexCube, GroupAsia & LifeAsia from DXC), but these solutions are 275 predominantly on-prem and are heavily dependent on an Oracle stack. This presents an opportunity to migrate & modernize these 276 applications (with support from our WW service teams), while engaging with the FSIs to deploy them, and will require a cohesive, 277 tripartite GTM approach between the ISV/GSIs, the banks and AWS. 3/ Continue engaging with regulators and strengthen AWS’ 278 role in “Make in India”. In addition to focused regulatory engagement to ensure cloud adoption by FSIs is viewed favourably by the 279 JAN 2024 | FY23 OP2 – FSI 
Amazon Confidential  Page 6 of 12 regulators, we need to build evidence for AWS’ role in the “Make in India” narrative beyond having local data centers (e.g., MSFT-280 Jio, OCI-Airtel), given the focus on self-reliance and an India Cloud. The Indian government is actively considering its options for a 281 “sovereign cloud”, to have more strategic control over cloud providers providing infrastructure to public sector and regulated 282 industries. Partnering with a reputed conglomerate like TATA Sons to build such an “India Cloud” offering will be crucial to ensure 283 AWS continues to be a player in the Indian FS industry. [Ask]:1/  Investment in a senior project management headcount to build 284 and manage an execution plan, including driving partner conversations, in collaboration with the PSM and GSI teams.2/ AWS WW 285 and APJ leadership commitment to drive regular (twice a year, once the project is conceptualized) interactions with CEOs of at least 286 4 banks (SBI, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank). A T2T2T (that includes partner CEO connect) will be crucial to accelerate such a 287 bold initiative in India, where cloud adoption in Banking is still very nascent.3/ A strategic partnership with a conglomerate like 288 TATA sons, to drive India Cloud offerings. 4/ Drive momentum in Public Sector Banks ($700M TAS): India has 10 Public sector Banks 289 (PSB) who contribute to 48% of the Retail-MSME credit market in India. Out of these, 6 PSBs will covered as Deep accounts (2 290 engaged – SBI, Canara; and 4 GF – BOB, PNB, BOI, UBI). The PSBs are publicly listed for-profit commercial organizations, but with 291 government shareholding, have unique organization structures (most top execs have a lifetime tenure at PSBs), complex & 292 consensus driven decision-making processes (via strictly defined RFP processes) and have traditionally been slow to adopt any new 293 technology compared to Private sector Banks in India (we est. a 18-24 months lag in tech adoption). However, with Private Banks 294 on a firm journey to public cloud adoption with material workloads, we have seen early signs of interest from PSBs to get started. 295 We will drive momentum in this sector to deliver ~4M in 2024 and $60M over 5 years. A detailed write-up on PSB is in Appendix 6. 296 5.0 Summary of key risks, dependencies and asks (beyond the asks for Big Bets): 297 1/ Constant Currency offerings for 5 years. As evidenced in the conversations with CAMS, HDFC Life (and it is expected to be an ask 298 by Public Sector Banks, as we make inroads), a 5-year INR pricing commercial construct is increasingly becoming critical to win in 299 India. 2/ In order to drive more revenue, expedite availability of MP and other strategic services (like Gen AI) in India. 3/ Competitive 300 ProServe pricing (as compared to other CSPs and large GSIs) will become a key requirement to move business critical workloads to 301 AWS at large FSIs. Indian FSIs, who are yet to become proficient builders, frequently require OEM skin in the game for mission 302 critical projects. Anecdotal feedback suggests we can be up to 2x competition currently, which is not scalable. This will also be 303 critical to win more standalone ProServe opportunities vs relying too heavily on PPA Attach. ProServe should also have the same 304 funding levers that are available for partners, to ensure parity 4/ Marketing: (a) Adequate funding for in-account initiatives for Deep 305 and some Focus-Select accounts.(b) An in-person FSI Forum for the top 25-30 FSI (across Enterprise and Fintech) stakeholders, to 306 enable networking, share learnings, deepen CXO connects and showcase our large transformation successes. 5/ Incremental 307 headcount: (a)  Specialist BD/SA pod for Gen AI and 1 Specialist BD/SA pod for Data/ Analytics, dedicated to FSI.(b) Incremental SA 308 coverage of 8 SAs (3 for Deep, 3 for Fintech, 1 for Focus and 1 for FSI ISV) to ensure adequate coverage (c) Dedicated program 309 manager to support FSI initiatives. 6/ Increased CSM coverage for all MAP 2.0 across Deep and Focus; CSM for every Deep account 310 billing more than $5M ARR. 7/ SSOE support to operationalize revenue sharing across FSI and ISV/SUP teams to drive better 311 collaboration between the teams. 8/ A specific comp for Public sector Banks in Deep Sales motion. These banks will take 2-3 years 312 to ramp-up owing to the slow bureaucratic processes in these organizations. Requesting a 2-3 year sales plan for AMs covering 313 Banks like SBI, Canara Bank, that are no longer in Greenfield as group entities are billing with AWS. Greenfield tag is assessed at the 314 parent level, leading to these 0 biller banks to not be eligible for a Greenfield compensation plan. 9/ TAS data used for segmentation 315 has data errors (e.g. IndusInd Bank, the 5th largest private sector bank, is shown with $11M TAS, while its microfinance subsidiary, 316 Bharat Financial, is show to have $29M TAS). Inaccuracies in TAS data has led to 2 large accounts moving to Scale (e.g. Indian 317 Overseas Bank, Indian Bank are among the top 10 Public sector banks in the country). Request for a window to correct these errors 318 for some obvious accounts. 319 6.0 Conclusion: 320 2023 was a challenging year for FSI. There have been multiple headwinds like intense focus on CO (over 50% of customers), loss of 321 a large account like Dhani (introduced a gap of $3.2M), Zscaler claw back of $3.8M (Full year) and some significant disruptive events 322 in the Fintech segment (covered earlier in the doc). However, there are significant tailwinds and FSI continues to be in a position to 323 drive good growth, if some big bets materialize and some of the regulatory and policy uncertainties are solved for. We also expect 324 a resurgence of the Fintech sector in 18-24 months time, when more investments are likely to come into this sector. We strongly 325 believe we will continue to outpace the India growth rate in this segment, and can move the integrated Enterprise and Fintech 326 vertical to a 30%+ growth in the next 24 months. The team enjoys high Earn Trust with customer stakeholders across all sub-327 verticals. We will continue to be intentional about retaining that trust. Senior stakeholders from 2 large banks remarked that they 328 have never seen any other technology vendor provide such support.  329 7.0 Frequently Asked Questions 330 7.1 What “dogs not barking” worry you?  331 1/ Ambiguity around Regulatory/ Policy direction around India Cloud and the ability to host business critical workloads on US HQed 332 CSPs (NSE who have scaled down their cloud footprint). Currently, UIDAI is not approving the use of cloud for Aadhar Vault and 333 AUA/KUA services. 2/ A push by regulators to explore cloud ready and CSP agnostic solutions, potentially slowing the down the 334 JAN 2024 | FY23 OP2 – FSI 
Amazon Confidential  Page 7 of 12 adoption of our cloud native services, the core of our modernization strategy. We continue to work closely with the PP team on 335 both topics. We will need a concerted effort, in collaboration with PS teams, to address the same.  336 7.2 How are competitors innovating in your area?  337 Competitors are relying on aggressive discounts to win targeted workloads (E.g. GCP at HDFC Ergo) rather than Innovation, with the 338 exception of the OpenAI partnership of MS. Early availability of Gen AI offerings in India (E.g. Vertex AI and Open AI) have provided 339 them a head start with FSI customers, with early whitelisting. We need Bedrock availability in India in early Q1’24. We will leverage 340 the GenAI Innovation Center as a strategic tool to drive business outcomes at large customers. 341 7.3 Which industry vertical initiatives are critical for growth acceleration? What support do you need from BDSI specialists?  342 Growth in Banking, and Retention in Fintech will be key factors to drive growth in FSI. We’ll need BDSI expertise to drive 343 transformational DC exit programs. Continued support of BDSI specialists in Deep and Focus Select will be needed to drive 344 conversations with LoB leaders. BDSI support will also be needed to establish AWS as a thought leader in driving business outcomes 345 in FSI through Industry events and supporting regional and WW CxO initiatives. This is required to bring global learnings to India as 346 well as offer a platform for Indian leaders to showcase their success globally. 347 Appendices 348 Appendix 1: Overview of FSI segment split 349

Amazon Confidential  Page 9 of 12 - Database ($24.7M ARR 2023 YTD, 10% YoY), Containers ($17.5M ARR 2023 YTD, 14% YoY), Analytics ($8.67M ARR 2023 YTD, -4% 362 YoY), AI/ML ($0.61M ARR 2023 YTD, 24% YoY). Key thematic areas of our wins and losses are: a) Containers:  We are able to influence 363 our customers to adopt containers (running on Graviton chips and spot instances) as infrastructure choice to optimize costs and 364 improve utilization. E.g. Upstox migrated their order management platform on EKS with Karpenter ($0.3M YTD Nov, 74% YoY), PayU 365 launched Thought Machine - a Core Banking application on EKS ($0.42M YTD Nov, 61% YoY), CoinDCX launched their DeFi/CeFI on 366 EKS  with Karpenter ($0.6M YTD Nov, 682% YoY), Paytm migrated and re-architected their Auth application from Ali-cloud to EKS 367 ($0.8M YTD Nov, 55% YoY), Polygon re-architected their monolith applications running on EC2 to ECS utilizing Fargate ($0.63M YTD 368 Nov, 2796% YoY). b) Databases: For relational use-cases such as transactional consistency, better performance and scalability, un-369 differentiated heavy lifting of database management and DR capabilities (with Aurora), customers such as Paytm, PayU, BharatPe, 370 Upstox, Razorpay continue to scale on RDS (especially RDS Aurora), thus driving the usage. For NoSQL use-cases, ‘Key-Value pair’ 371 requirement is the most sought after and is extensively used in use-cases such as data-store for micro-services, other applications 372 which can work with eventual consistency model. For such use-cases, Dynamo DB is preferred by customers such as Paytm (Ads 373 team), PayU, CoinDCX due to its performance and serverless architecture. Besides Dynamo DB, we’re also seeing interest from 374 Fintech customers such as Polygon technology, PayU, Navi Technology, Paytm for storing JSON data as documents, thus driving up 375 the utilization of Document DB. c) Analytics: Customers such as Navi Technologies, Paytm, PayU, Slice, Polygon have continued to 376 build and scale their data pipelines using Lakehouse architecture which has driven the usage of Amazon Managed Streaming for 377 Kafka ($1.3M YTD Nov, 36% YoY), EMR ($2.2M YTD Nov, 55% YoY) and Athena ($0.55M YTD Nov, 1% YoY). Slice, a fintech major in 378 Lending business have migrated from Databricks to EMR (#winback from compete ISVs, contributing to EMR ) as EMR is able to 379 offer a better price to performance and more choices of run-times (such as Flink, Trino). Customers undertook various optimization 380 activities on their OpenSearch clusters e.g. archival/periodic maintenance of data, graviton adoption, node re-sizing which led to 381 reduction of OpenSearch usage (and hence 18% YoY drop in revenue). Redshift usage also contracted ($1.17M YTD Nov, -36% YoY) 382 as customers moved to Lakehouse architecture 383 Appendix 5: Gen AI update: 384 Across traditional FSI enterprises, 34 GenAI sessions across 23 FSI customers were conducted. These sessions were attended by 385 600+ attendees and received an avg CSAT of 4.5/5. Apart from customer sessions, 2 enablement sessions conducted for field teams 386 covering the basics of Gen AI, AWS services positioning, demos, industry use cases and partners to engage. These sessions led to 387 discussion of 22 customer uses cases across various customers across 11 FSI customers, among which 5 POCs are currently in 388 progress. Based on the POC discussions 22 customer influences for Amazon Bedrock availability in BOM region were created 389 influencing $517K. SA team has 3 GenAI ambassadors and co-owned the AWS Generative AI Hackathon Playbook . This document 390 helped the SA team conduct 14 Workshops / Hackathons (including Axis Bank) across multiple customers across India and attended 391 by 1200+ participants. Details can be found in https://quip-amazon.com/ZgCoAatZU0yb/AWS-Generative-AI-Hackathon-Playbook-392 for-ENT. There has been executive engagement with service teams at Axis Bank (Bedrock, Kendra & Plato), HDFC Bank (Gen AI 393 focussed EBC), BFL (Gen AI focussed EBC). This has led to PoCs at all these customers, Axis Bank PoC is in progress & at other 394 customers in discussion.  395 Enterprise Wins - From customer adoption of AWS GenAI services, GaadiBazaar (NLP powered query) is in CUG, MaxLife 396 (conversational bot for agents) has been rolled out to be used by 1000 support agents (Winner in AI Conclave) and ICICI Lombard 397 has deployed 2 uses case (Chatbots) in Pre-prod.  Additionally, we have got one of our Focus customers - Fincare Small Finance 398 Bank experimenting with Claude and Titan and will go live in Q1 24 ($100k) 399 Across Fintech : Across 4 deep accounts (Paytm, Quadeye Securities, Razorpay, Cred) - we’ve done 10+ sessions with these 400 customers covering technical topics such as Sagemaker Jumpstart, CodeWhisperer, Bedrock, recently launched services Amazon Q, 401 QuickSight Q (done at Paytm only) resulting in a) Paytm evaluating Sagemaker Jumpstart, Bedrock for use-cases such as 402 Personalised QR generation, document Q&A to improve the productivity of operations team and            Code Whisperer b) Razorpay 403 has successfully completed a PoC of Amazon Bedrock (using Claude V2) to build a merchant assistance bot which will replace a 404 similar bot built with OpenAI. Razorpay is moving out of OpenAI due to better pricing of ClaudeV2 when compared to OpenAI. 405 Razorpay is also evaluating Amazon              Bedrock (Claude) vs OpenAI to create an automated data-dictionary for Data-406 warehousing tables. c) Happay, part of Cred, is evaluating Amazon Bedrock (Claude V2) to build an expense management 407 application. We’ve partnered with WWSO team to drive these GenAI engagements which included activities such as - customer 408 leadership engagement to create mindshare on AWS services, in-account developer engagement thru GenAI hackathons 409 (conducted in 1 each at Paytm and Razorpay), customer enablement, support in technical evaluation of AWS GenAI services and 410 engagement with WW GenAI team. Thru our activities in these accounts, we’ve been able to secure the sponsorship of key customer 411 stakeholders such as CTO, Head of Data Science.  412 Fintech Wins: Our activities in 2023 has resulted in 2 GenAI launches at Paytm. a) Launch of personalised QR code in Paytm app 413 using Stable Diffusion to celebrate Indian Independence Day (ARR $60K) b) Rent agreement analysis using Textract, Sagemaker 414 Jumpstart (Cohere Generate Model - Command) for text summarization, Q&A (ARR $66K).  415 JAN 2024 | FY23 OP2 – FSI 
Amazon Confidential  Page 10 of 12 Challenges/Learnings: a) To comply with data residency requirements, fintech customers are seeking Bedrock availability in BOM 416 region. Additionally, for Bedrock BOM region launch we would need feature parity with N. Virginia region viz. Agents, Knowledge 417 Base as customers like Paytm are seeking these features (PFR link from Paytm account)  b) Prompt engineering in Bedrock is 418 verbose when compared with OpenAI e.g. in situations wherein calculations need to be done, OpenAI can invoke external agents 419 seamlessly without end users doing prompt engineering (such as agents and tools). Customer developers have also mentioned to 420 us that with OpenAI, there is a plethora of tutorials/online guides available. Claude has limited amount of prompt engineering 421 (and other help guides) available and at times this has become a blocker during evaluation stages c) For certain use-cases, we’ve 422 found that OpenAI is able to provide better prediction accuracy when compared with Bedrock e.g. at Razorpay for multi-lingual 423 Auto-eKYC use-case, OpenAI was found to provide a better prediction accuracy when compared to Claude on Amazon Bedrock d) 424 We’ve not been successful in helping our customer adopt Code Whisperer in compete against Github Co-pilot. Feedbacks 425 received – 1/ The number of English words needed by CodeWhisperer to  generate working code sample is verbose when 426 compared to Github Co-pilot  2/ Code Whisperer had been un-able to scan existing code repositories thereby   limiting the 427 developers’ ability to use in daily situations. In FY24, we will re-engage our customers on Code Whisperer basis of the reinvent 428 launches. 429 Appendix 6: Think Big for Public Sector Banks: 430 Plan for 2024: India has 10 Public sector Banks (PSB) who contribute to 48% of the Retail-MSME credit market in India. Out of these, 431 6 PSBs will covered as Deep accounts (2 engaged – SBI, Canara; and 4 GF – BOB, PNB, BOI, UBI), with a combined estimated TAS of 432 ~$900M. The PSBs are publicly listed for-profit commercial organizations, but with government shareholding, have unique 433 organization structures (most top execs have a lifetime tenure at PSBs), complex & consensus driven decision-making processes 434 (via strictly defined RFP processes) and have traditionally been slow to adopt any new technology compared to Private sector Banks 435 in India (we est. a 18-24 months lag in tech adoption). However, with Private Banks on a firm journey to public cloud adoption with 436 material workloads, we have seen early signs of interest from PSBs to get started. Some key beachheads, we currently have in PSBs 437 include Co-lending platform at SBI (Yubi), Canara (SFDC SRRP win via RFP), PNB (CRMNext win, $3M/5Y), UBI (VMCA for T&D, $650K 438 ARR committed stage), Central Bank Housing Finance ($200K ARR), SBI GIC ($3.6M/3Y PPA), Canara HSBC ($200K ARR), etc. To put 439 them on a firm path to AWS cloud, we will drive the following key initiatives in 2024: 1/ Building a security & compliance foundation: 440 In 2024, we will focus on building a strong security & compliance foundation helping build awareness across security and other 441 teams, and help them better understand the operational controls needed on AWS to meet their regulatory needs. This should 442 culminate in building a landing zone across these Banks. Landing zone plans have already been kickstarted at SBI with discussions 443 in progress at PNB and UBI; 2/ Building executive sponsorship for Cloud adoption: by engaging CIOs and Executive Directors (EDs 444 are function heads who report into MDs) to build mindshare drive specific call-to-actions of identifying the first set of workloads to 445 be migrated 3/ Joint account planning with key ISVs: Work on joint account planning with key strategic ISVs such as CRMNext, SFDC, 446 Nucleus, Lentra, Newgen, Finacle, Mindgate, TCS Bancs, Workapps, etc. E.g.: This has helped us identify opportunities in SBI, PNB, 447 Canara, etc. with two key wins (with CRMNext at PNB, $3M/5yr; and SFDC at Canara Bank) 4/ Align with incumbent and challenger 448 GSIs/Large SI partners (atleast 2 per account): All PSBs have major GSIs as their outsourcing partners. PSBs typically award end-to-449 end RFPs for specific applications/initiatives on a turnkey basis for 5/ 7 years including implementation and managed services to an 450 SI/GSIs. Early alignment will help us engage/identify early Pre-RFP stage opportunities. 6/ Skilling and enablement: Given their low 451 Cloud awareness levels, we will work to drive both broad based and executive skilling and enablement initiatives across these 452 accounts including leveraging marketing (ABM). 7/ Focus on Banking Subsidiaries for In-year growth: PSBs have Insurance, cards, 453 securities, NBFC or wealth mgmt. subsidiaries who generally have more autonomy in decision making (relative to the Parent Bank) 454 due to their governance structure and smaller size. Some subsidiaries such as Canara HSBC, SBI GIC, etc. have already started on 455 Cloud/AWS with key applications, giving us an opportunity to accelerate them in 2024. Tactically, the above key initiatives will be 456 captured in an account plan collaborating with extended teams to drive our alignment and focus. We will also engage external 457 influencers and bodies such as IBA (Indian Banking Association, which is dominated by PSB members) to drive thought leadership 458 (E.g.: participating in industry events such as IBA Awards & pursue joint publishing of whitepapers) or one-to-many 459 initiatives/workshops on Cloud transformation. The key sales plays will include: a/ ISV aligned sales play; b/ Data platforms, 460 regulatory reporting & ML; c/ Security and threat intelligence solutions to engage CISO offices; d/ VMCA, as a point of entry for 461 T&D, peripheral workloads (replicate the win with UBI, $650K ARR) e/ Digital Banking (a big investment area for PSBs as they try to 462 raise their digital customer experiences to become on-par with Private Banks); f/ Co-lending and Agri lending solutions play: PSBs 463 have a lion’s share of Agri & ‘priority sector’ lending market India. We believe, our increased investments into PSBs from 2024 464 coupled with the specific strategies listed about should set us on path to unlock their potential and drive accelerated growth to 10X 465 to an est. ~27.5M ARR by FY27 (from <$2.3M in2023). 466 JAN 2024 | FY23 OP2 – FSI

For the Focus cohort of accounts, 474 marketing will focus on mapping industry and LoB use cases, identify 1P + 3P solutions to address them, and curate localized GTM 475 activities. Our effort is to prioritize FSI deep accounts and high value Fintech/ Enterprise Focus accounts by a) Driving a retention 476 play with Top 20 customers (69% of segment revenue) with curated interventions like ABM in account events, FSI dedicated track 477 in Summit, FSI only ExecLeaders, bigger participation in the Fintech forum, higher representation at re:Invent and EBC roaster. b) 478 Building growth plays for Next 43 accounts (Focus Select, 19% of FSI revenue) through India properties like FSI Conclave (25+ CXOs 479 and 250+ITDM audience), Customer events like Razorpay FTX, industry association/Analyst events (Gartner/IBA/ IDC), CxO Forum 480 engagements in partnership with ISV (Lentra) and community led engagements like FSI Tech Leaders Assembly (ITDMs focused). c) 481 Driving Scale Enablement Motions for Focus core will happen primarily via digital properties i.e. APJ led digital programs like 482 innovate, webinars, virtual account workshops and selective 3rd party industry events like IDG100, ET BFSI forum, CNBC Gen AI 483 forum. We will also accelerate our efforts on building brand plays with leading publishers especially for FSI. We have to scale our 484 FSI References by >2X. While we have had 10+ referenceable assets created in the last 12 months (HDFC Life/Axis Bank), we need 485 to double down on case studies as FSI customers take longer to approve case studies/ PTI articles. We did 5 written FSI case studies 486 in last 12 months (Freecharge, Paytm, Setu)  and have  additional 3 case studies in progress( SBI Life, Max Life & HDFC) 487 Appendix 8: Cross-service PPA in Fintech 488 Account Name Term Length Deal Expiration Date  TCV Paytm Mobile Solutions Pvt.

Amazon Confidential  Page 1 of 12 The purpose of this document is to give the reader an overview of the Financial Services business in India, some context around the 1 India nuances, key macro factors that are driving behaviour around cloud adoption, plans for FY24 and our big bets. 2 Vision: FSI vision is to be the ‘Transformation Partner’ of choice for the FSI Industry and a catalyst for cultural transformation and 3 Innovation. We want to be the largest CSP (primary/ preferred cloud provider) for the top 10 customers in Banking, Insurance, 4 Capital Markets and NBFC. Currently, we are meaningfully engaged at 7/10 Private sector banks (largest CSP at 4), top 9 insurers 5 (both life and non-life insurance companies, largest at 7) and 14 of 16 non-banking financial companies. We plan to enable Fintechs 6 to become the preferred rails for "Digital Public Infrastructure", while increasing our wallet share further to 85%+, from the current 7 79%. In the next 5 years, we aspire to build this into a $1B business. 8 1.0 Business Overview: 9 1.1 Historical trends, TAS, view of Greenfield, Net new vs. Recurring: 10 Financial Services segment covers ~$3B in TAS. Banking sub-segment is 11 by-far the largest with low penetration, which gives a significant 12 runway for growth, with the right regulatory conditions. 11% of these 13 accounts are Greenfield, representing 20% of the TAS. A big percentage 14 of this is in Public Sector Banks. The adjacent table gives a breakdown 15 of accounts covered in each segment, the associated GAR and TAS. A 16 deeper strategy to grow this segment is covered in our Think Big Plan. 17 Note: TAS data used for segmentation has data errors (e.g. Web3 applications, which represent Crypto, GAR is more than TAS). For the sake of consistency, we have used the same data 18 used for segmentation. Directionally, the spread of TAS and the overall numbers are realistic and should give a good idea of the industry. 19 1.2 Headwinds/ Tailwinds: 20 There are significant tailwinds in Banking, where rapid growth in digital payments and adoption of digital channels (post Covid) is 21 driving digital transformation projects across the industry. This largely drove the Fintech growth over the last few years, helped by 22 the exponential growth in UPI (digital B2C and C2C/P2P payments). UPI volume in Dec 2023 touched $208B (11.4B transactions). 23 UPI volume has grown at a CAGR of 168% from 2017-18 from $12B to $1.7T. Banks are increasingly looking at Cloud-first strategies 24 to drive Innovation as well as build resiliency and scalability for highly volatile workloads like payments. Indian FS market is still 25 largely underserved (only ~70% of Indians have Bank accts, with credit & insurance at <10% penetration), which provides a large 26 runway for growth for FS industry in India, beyond the current TAS. Large Private sector FS players are investing in modernizing 27 platforms to plan capacity for future growth driven by favourable demographics, and increasingly looking at cloud-native 28 architectures to drive business agility or lower costs (E.g.: Postgres is becoming the first choice over Oracle for CX workloads). Banks 29 are investing in in-house build capabilities esp. for Digital platforms, which positions AWS favourably due to our developer & startup 30 ecosystem in India. There are a few headwinds that might slow down revenue growth that are 31 largely uncontrollable. 1/ Cost. There is an intense focus on Cost Optimization as customers try to 32 put more governance on cloud costs. Cheap labour costs and favourable on-prem pricing is not 33 enabling a significant price differential in the early stages of the cloud journey. Traditional and 34 new players, like Adani and Jio, are coming up with competitive price-points for FS customers to 35 continue investing on-prem. 2/ Geo-political/ Regulatory uncertainty. Inconsistent policies (E.g. 36 Central Banking Digital Currency not allowed to go on public cloud; SEBI, Securities Regulator, has been sending mixed messages in 37 private conversations with regulated entities on moving critical workloads to public cloud) have created ambiguity and hence 38 cautiousness in any rapid movement to the cloud. RBI (Banking regulator) has also recently indicated an intent to offer its own cloud 39 facility for hosting critical workloads. Geo-political risks and an implicit nudge for an India cloud (owned/operated by an Indian 40 company) option is increasing complexity. NBFCs have also come under intense regulatory scrutiny and have been restricted to 41 grow some aspects (like lending). 3/ FX volatility is driving demand for INR pricing. 4/ Funding winter is expected to continue for 42 most of 2024. 2023 saw a precipitous drop in funding from $9.6B in 2021, $6B in 2022 to $2.1B in 2023 (Source: Tracxn), leading to 43 muted growth expectation of Fintech revenue in 2024. Crypto industry is also on the decline owing to regulatory ambiguity (Crypto 44 customers have already reduced usage by an avg. 12% in 2023). 5/ Increase in competitive activity, who are trying to reduce the 45 gap with aggressive pricing options, and INR pricing. Most Indian FSIs are India-focused and don’t have a large multinational 46 engagement. They don’t have a FX risk from their core business and do not want that to be introduced because of their IT spend. 47 1.3 Cloud/customer/segment maturity  48 Banks will continue to provide the largest runway for growth (45% of FSI TAS, 4% wallet share in terms of GAR), as seen in section 49 1.1. The journey started in 2020 and only private sector banks have begun their move to the cloud over the last 3 years. Public 50 Sector Banks (~$700M+ TAS) are poised to begin their journey this year and will be a Think Big bet for driving FS growth. Most 51 private sector insurers (e.g. ICICI Lombard, HDFC Life, BAGIC) and Capital Markets (e.g. Angel One, Motilal Oswal, HDFC AMC) 52 entities have moved most workloads to the cloud through Lift+Shift migrations. Modernization and migration of core systems, 53 Innovation, Data modernization, Gen AI will be key focus in these sectors. Private sector banks continue to be large buyers of ISV 54 solutions but are also starting to transform themselves into builders (e.g. HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, Kotak Bank), starting with CX and 55 Sub-Segment# AccountsTTM GAR$TASGAR % TASBanking53$56,276,852$1,302,471,8444%NBFC31$14,596,645$534,057,5403%Insurance41$35,987,140$450,006,8998%Payments64$200,910,108$356,767,63456%Capital Markets/Securities55$53,861,145$243,787,84822%Financial Services - Other13$6,983,625$17,955,57739%Web3 Apps (Crypto)5$18,408,776$17,560,996105%Software2$956,871$1,588,17060%Grand Total264$387,981,163$2,924,196,50813%

They are builders who are driving Innovation through technology.  57 1.4 Market segment positioning / Noteworthy 2023 progress/successes 58 2023 was a year of many firsts including large PPA’s with 2 of the Top 3 private sector Banks (HDFC Bank: $80M/5Y; Axis Bank: 59 $90M/5Y– largest for any CSP in India Enterprise FSI); Large SRRP deals with Zscaler at HDFC Bank (TCV: $40M/5Y) and ICICI Bank 60 (TCV: $62M/6Y), first Salesforce SRRP deal in AWS India at HDFC Bank, Deployment of secondary envt of CRMNext at Axis Bank. We 61 also saw acceleration of modernization of core workloads (e.g. TCS BaNCS Policy Administration System at SBI  GIC, and core digital 62 platforms like Optimus, Mobile+ Net banking, at IDFC First Bank, Thought Machine, Core Banking for new digital products, at IDFC 63 First and PayU). In Analytics, Amazon Redshift became a platform of choice at Angel One, Kotak Bank and Motilal Oswal. With 64 Fintech customers, there was significant progress around  1/ Graviton adoption (improved from ~5.5% in Jan-23 to 8.9% in Nov-23) 65 2/ Improved PPA  Coverage from 79%  to 86% of 2023 revenue; 24 (out of 52) customers under PPA. Wins: PayU ($60M/3Y), 66 Razorpay ($50M/3Y), Navi ($20M/5Y), and Bharatpe ($18M/3Y); 3/ Enterprise Support Penetration: 16 (out of top 20) on ES with 3 67 net-new wins in 2023. YTD Nov, strategic services adoption by Fintechs have grown 17% (~$54M in 2022 to ~$63M in 2023).   68 1.5 What is the 3Y/5Y vision? What will you be doing in 2024 to get closer to that vision? 69 We aspire to grow the FSI business to $1B in 5 years. Beyond the BAU Sales plays, we will continue to focus on the FSI Industry 70 Solutions IGA to drive business outcomes on AWS; deepen our Fintech engagement, increasing our wallet share by driving more 71 Pan-Amazon synergies and hence stickiness to AWS; making big bets around Public Sector Banks ($700M+ TAS) and 72 transformational DC Exits in a few large Private Sector banks, to drive significant growth in 3-5 years. Details in Think Big section.  73 2.0 FY23 Summary, observations, and learnings 74 2.1 Overall performance - vertical/segment 75 As highlighted in section 1.2, the 76 Banking segment is driving a healthy 77 growth ($53M, 68% Nov’23 YTD, YoY) 78 as the largest private sector banks 79 adopt a cloud first strategy to drive 80 Innovation, deliver better CX. Banks 81 have taken a measured approach to cloud adoption and have not embarked on large lift and shift initiatives. Instead, they are taking 82 a modernization approach to determine which applications need to be moved to the cloud. As applications have gotten complex 83 (like CRM, Loan management systems), the project and sales life cycles have increased (by 14-16%), leading to a slower growth rate 84 than years past (where growth was driven by non-critical applications). Public Sector Banks have just begun to consider cloud for 85 some of their transformation initiatives. We won the first few opportunities (CRMNext at Punjab National Bank, $3M/5Y) and Union 86 Bank of India ($600K ARR) that will begin their deployment journey in 2024. Insurance continues to have mixed growth ($28M, 17% 87 Nov’23 YTD, YoY) with some large accounts HDFC Life ($4.7M , -5% Nov’23 YTD YoY), BAGIC+BALIC ($2.65M, 14% Nov’23 YTD YoY), 88 ICICI Pru Life ($2.2M, 4% Nov’23 YTD YoY), in the final stages of their migrations. The current growth is being driven by core 89 modernization and data initiatives at Acko General Insurance ($2.1M, 86% Nov’23 YTD YoY), Max Life ($2.2M, 27% Nov’23 YTD YoY), 90 Star Health, ($1.3M, 52% Nov’23 YTD YoY). Capital Markets (50% YoY), with seen strong growth in 6 of the top 8 accounts, driven 91 by new app development and data initiatives at Angel Broking ($7M, 61% Nov’23 YTD YoY), DC Exit at HDFC AMC ($1.1M , 336% 92 Nov’23 YTD YoY). Fintech overall has slowed down due to the funding winter, as evidenced in section 1.2. E.g.: Razorpay (Usage -93 10% YoY), Cred ( -8%), Upstox (-19%), Simpl (-17%). However, the trends are mixed with sectors like Capital Markets (Quadeye: 94 +112%, Zerodha-32%), Digital Lending (Navi:+183%, Truebalance:+147%), and Insurtech (Acko:+77% Policy Bazar:+32%) have seen 95 growth while others like Crypto (Industry:-21%), and Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL, Slice:- 17%) have declined. Fintech customers like 96 Quadeye grew by entering new markets; Payments startups were focused on cross/upselling to their existing customers. E.g.: Navi 97 entered into insurance, mutual funds & wealth management and Zerodha diversified into fund management. Paytm growth was 98 also aided by consolidation of workloads on to AWS (~$10M ARR), from regions outside India. Apart from shutting down non-99 profitable business, Fintechs have also taken hard measures such as RIF(Reductions in workforce) e.g.: Cred (35%), PayU (6%), 100 Polygon (20%), CoinDCX (25%) to increase the runway in their business.  101 2.2 Key callouts on team structure, tenure, culture, diversity, connections scores, hiring, RA/URA 102 The FS team comprises of 38 resources (35 BIS), which includes 3 FLMs (tenure ranging from 6-10 years at 103 Amazon); 33 ICs (30 BIS, 3 Women); 1 FSI ISV BD and 1 Program Manager. 39% of the team is less than 2 years 104 at Amazon, while 42% of the team is over 4 years at Amazon, making it a healthy mix of relatively new and 105 tenured Amazonians. Diversity Ratio needs to be improved and we will be intentional in the hiring of TBHs. There 106 are also 2 employees currently on Pivot and 1 employee (RA) serving a notice period. All managers are new to 107 their teams and connection score are not available, right now, that reflects the sentiment of the new org. FSI org 108 has 4 L5s, 24 L6s and 7 L7s, apart from 3 L7Ms as FLMs. The 3 FLMs have 9 (ENT FSI Focus), 10 (Fintech) and 13 (ENT FSI Deep) as 109 span of controls. FSI Segment leader will have 6 people reporting directly as outlined at the beginning of this section, with the 110 addition of the AM for SBI, who will report directly for span of control purposes.

We have been intentional about our team’s wellbeing/development and 112 executing it through 3 pillars 1/FSI Weekly Connect: We bring the FSI sellers together every week to collaborate with functional 113 teams like Partner, ProServe, Training, Marketing team etc. to make our FSI customer successful in their cloud journey. 2/FSI 114 Falcons: FSI AMs, SAs and BDSI teams come together monthly to learn and share insights on new use cases deployed, customer 115 innovations, Progress made with our FSI customers and go deep with some of marquee wins and solutions to make it a repeatable. 116 We will continue both of these engagements in FY24. 3/Upskilling and Career Development: We initiated the ENT Enablement 117 Friday series in 2023 to upskill/enable our team on themes like FSI Specific solutions/ offerings, Industry Specific solutions, Strategic 118 Services, Executive Engagement and Sales Skills sessions led by FE and Industry teams. In FY24, we will plan 20 such enablement 119 workshops and drive programs like FSI/Fintech Ready Program GenAI Refresher Program, Growth Mindset Program. FSI Path’shala’ 120 is a monthly enablement mechanism where we invite strategic ISVs to present their FSI Industry Solutions and USPs. Objective is to 121 equip AWS account teams with functional understanding of the solution and be able to make an initial pitch to FSI customers. Last 122 year we conducted 15 FSI Path'shala sessions and this year we plan to conduct 20. 123 2.3 Successes / performance outcomes against strategy (strategic services) 124 Migrations, Data/ Analytics/ AIML, ISV solutions were key sales plays in 2023. ISV progress is covered in the IGA update. Migrations 125 continue to work well, driving good growth in ENT FSI. Against a 2023 stretch target of $36M migration ARR, we have closed 21 126 (30% of ENT) MAPs with a migration ARR of $51.4M (143% of stretch target). Major migration wins have been from Insurance ( 6 127 out of 21 wins) and Banks (9 out of 21 wins) and rest from NBFC (4, including 1 from Bajaj Finance Ltd, Microsoft’s largest NBFC 128 account), Capital markets(2). In the Fintech space, we have identified 5 Migration prospects (Phone pay, Billdesk, Paisa Bazaar, 129 Wimbo, CC Avenue)  with $25M TAS in our cohort where we plan to close min 2 MAP wins ($3M) in 2024 and acquire all 5 customers 130 ($20M) by FY26. The FSI AI/ML revenue grew by 16% ($1.85M, Nov’23 YTD), driven by 27% growth in the Fintech segment ($785K 131 Nov’23 YTD), led by Paytm ($380K Nov’23 YTD, 100% YoY). The FSI Ent segment grew at 10%($1.3M Nov’23 YTD) owing to degrowth 132 in IDFC First Bank (Nov YTD, $572K, -17% YoY, owing to EDP and Sagemaker Savings plan discounts) and RBL Bank ($90K Nov’23 133 YTD, -52% YoY, due to reduced experimentation and stopping usage of Transcribe). The Analytics revenue grew by 25% ($17.8M, 134 Nov’23 YTD), driven by a 76% growth in FSI Ent segment ($7M, Nov’23 YTD) led by Angel Broking ($1.1M, Nov’23 YTD, 313% YTD, 135 YoY). 2023 saw a healthy 75% Partner attach rate for the Ent FSI segment, up from 70% in 2022, led by collaboration with GSI’s like 136 Deloitte (Indusind Bank, Axis Bank), Accenture (AU Small Finance Bank), TCS (Max Life). In FY’23 YTD (till Oct’23), strategic services 137 contribution to Fintech accounts contribution has increased by 9% (2023 YTD at $51.5M vs FY22 YTD at $47.5M); Database is at 138 $24.7M 2023 YTD, 10% YoY, Containers  at $17.5M 2023 YTD, 14% YoY, Analytics at $8.67M 2023 YTD, -4% YoY and AI/ML is at 139 $0.61M 2023 YTD, 24% YoY.

We have since 145 reworked our forecasts, identified 146 opportunities, worked on pipeline targets for a 147 Fast start (see Appendix 2), factored early outcomes of some Big Bets (FSI ISV, PSB) which now translates to a 22% YoY growth rate 148 (40% ENT FSI and 10% Fintech), which is significantly better than the Nov Forecasts, but still carries risk in Fintech Forecast, 149 especially. We are identifying a PTG for the remaining gap over the next few weeks. In summary, we continue to expect growth in 150 the Banking and Capital Markets verticals. Insurance will be muted but will grow at a moderate pace. There is limited baseline 151 erosion in Enterprise FSI accounts (E.g. NSE $2.55M, RBL $1.57M) but there are headwinds in Fintech. In Fintech, Quadeye (Entered 152 new markets, and crypto) and Paytm (consolidation from other regions to India) had one-time events in 2023 that will not recur in 153 FY24. We expect our big bets to start paying dividends in FY25 and beyond and are confident of reaching $1B in 5Y. 154 Revenue Concentration: Top 19% (32 out of 171) of 155 the accounts, when viewed at a parent level, drive 80% 156 of FSI Revenue. At the child level, this translates to Top 157 17% of the 264 accounts driving 80% of the revenue. 158 However, the long tail of FSI is growing at a much faster 159 rate than the top accounts, which should help reduce concentration. 160 3.1 Sales motion implementation and verticalization 161 Sales Motions: The FSI Deep (ENT) segment ($66M YTD Nov’23), comprises 13 Banks (~$1B TAS, 7 PSU, 6 Private Sector Banks) 162 including subsidiaries and 1 large NBFC group (Bajaj Finserv) and will be addressed with 14 AMs (12 BIS, 1 open HC, 1 to be raised), 163 and 14 SAs. To drive optimal coverage, accounts >500K ARR will have 1:1 AM to account coverage ratio, with 5 Greenfield PSU Banks 164 at 1:2.5 coverage ratio. The key pillars of our GTM will include: 1/ Influence the cultural transformation of the largest FSIs in India: 165 To become the innovation partner of their choice by positively influencing their culture, we will invest in long term executive 166 relationships with CXOs (aligning exec sponsors from AWS), leverage CXO engagement mechanisms such as COI/WB to help them 167

Amazon Confidential  Page 4 of 12 accelerate their pace of innovation (making it real with Prototyping and Hackathons), Envisioning workshops/LFA/EBCs to better 168 unpack their transformation agendas to align better to their goals, and leverage BCAP/GSI Partners to build credible transformation 169 proposals for these large FS behemoths. 2/ Migration & modernization focus of ISV workloads (E.g.: Lentra/Mindgate at HDFC 170 Bank, Finacle Lite at Axis Bank etc) will continue to drive in-year revenue with FSI IGA helping us unlock better GTM and cloud-171 native stack readiness of these ISVs. Our investment in CSMs coupled with ES will help us accelerate execution 3/ CX and Digital 172 Banking: To harness a key trend of these large Banks investing in in-house builders to esp. build CX & digital platforms, our focus 173 on T&C, Account Based Marketing & enablement (to be detailed in an account plan) will help us build skills and nurture AWS 174 champions across the breadth of their organization. 4/ Public Sector Banks: Within the PSU Bank space, we have begun to make 175 headway with the creation of a dedicated landing zone at State Bank of India (India’s largest Bank), CRMNext win(5Y/$3M) at Punjab 176 National Bank(3rd largest PSU) and Cloud transformation VMCA win at Union Bank of India($600K ARR). For 2024, unlocking PSBs 177 is a big bet, the plan for which is elaborated in our Think Big plan. 178 FSI Focus (ENT) consists of 118 accounts (child a/cs) spread across 9 territories (with 1 dedicated GRN territory with ~24 accounts) 179 with $59M TTM revenue, spread across sub-industries as 44 banking (or lending/NBFCs), 21 capital market cos, 18 insurers and rest 180 as other misc. financial services providers. The average coverage ratio in engaged territories is 1:11 in ENG and 1:24 in GRN. The 181 territories are regionally spread as Mumbai (5), Chennai (1), BLR (1) and Delhi (1) with an optimal mix of Focus core and select 182 accounts. One territory in Mumbai is predominantly focused on Capital Markets, while the rest are a mixed across sub verticals. FSI 183 Focus sales motion will help customer drive their transformation goals by 1/ Driving industry specific solutions, esp. with LOB 184 stakeholders across Digital banking, lending solutions, CX, risk management, underwriting, claims, analytics, etc. These solutions 185 will be tailored with partners (SIs/GSIs) or vertical ISVs driving a co-sell motion or migrating/upgrading solutions from on-prem to 186 cloud. 2/ Migrations and modernization will continue to be a focus to win new tactical workloads or establish a long-term cloud 187 roadmap to eventually drive DC exit opportunities; 3/ Partners: Align with specific partners (SI/GSIs –atleast 2 per customer) 188 captured in a territory plan (to be completed before Mar 1st) and driven by PSMs for proactive interlock and cadence. 4/ Marketing 189 & Innovation Programs: Leverage FS industry specific marketing programs (3rd party Industry events, ExecLeaders, FS Symposium 190 & roundtables) to drive net new contact acquisition or nurture exec relationships. To better align with cultural transformation 191 agenda of our customers, DI (both 1:1 & IXA format) will be key to help us become the preferred Innovation partner. (Appendix 7).  192 FSI Fintech business consists of 4 Deep accounts (3 from Payment and 1 from Capital Markets, with $119M TAS and $94.6M TTM 193 revenue) and the Focus cohort consists of 51 accounts (37 in Payments, 5 in Crypto, 4 Capital Markets & 5 Insurers) spread across 194 6 territories with $355M TAS and $99M TTM revenue in 2023, to be covered by 6 AMs and 5 SAs across 6 territories. 2024 Focus: 195 1/ Increase our Share of Wallet (SOW): With increased competitive activity in the last 18 months, we will continue to focus on 196 increasing our 79% share in our top 20 fintech accounts, which contribute to 86% of Fintech revenue. This year, we will target to 197 have a PPA with all Top 20 customers. We currently have 19 but 6 of them are up for renewal in 2024. (Details in Appendix 8). 2/ 198 Strengthen Executive connects: We will continue our focus to build deeper connects with our top 20 customers esp. with 199 Founder/CEO/CTO relationships through 1:1 Executive connects, AWS marketing forums for builders (Mumbai Summit, ReInvent, 200 AI Conclave etc.) and leveraging existing Marketing programs such as  the FSI Symposium. We will also leverage One Amazon 201 initiatives to drive Pan-Amazon synergies, e.g.: A.in relationships with PayU for Payment processing and Razorpay for Digital Suite 202 offerings. 3/ Operational excellence: We will complete Value maps and Account plans for top 20 customers by 15th Feb with 203 operational cadences to drive execution of the plans. Cost Optimisation will be a priority for our top customers with a goal to 204 improve the COI score from avg. of 63 to 73 by end of FY24, also increase the Graviton adoption from 8.9% to 13%. 4/ Focus on 205 next set of High Growth Accounts: We will identify the “Next 15” (from Focus) accounts & target opportunities in whitespaces. E.g. 206 Analytics/AIML opportunities in 5 of our 20 accounts that are not using AWS native services. 5 Migration prospects (PhonePe, 207 BillDesk, Paisabazaar, Wimbo, CCAvenue) and drive $3M in 2024.  208 Partner Motion: Partner attach in ENT FSI (excluding Fintechs) has grown to 75% in 2023 (vs. 70.1% in 2022). We aim to take this 209 further to 80%+ in 2024. Fintechs, who are largely builders had a partner attach of 33.2% (vs. 28% in 2022). In 2024 our partner 210 strategy will revolve around the following 4 key pillars in FSI: 1/ Proactively Partnering with GSIs to drive transformational 211 outcomes: Our engagement with GSIs has grown significantly (over 70% YoY) in 2023 for 3 out of top 5 GSIs. Overall GSI pipeline 212 grew over 137% YoY to $21.89M, reflecting both GSI interest, AWS Sellers engaging partners pro-actively and the preference from 213 customers in transformational opportunities. Some large transformational projects with GSIs in 2023 included HDFC Bank (Deloitte 214 cloud consulting), Bajaj Finserv Group (TCS), Equitas Bank (IBM, digital banking build). PSMs will own and drive Partner plans with 215 proactive interlock with key GSIs (at least 1 incumbent and 1 challenger GSI in every ENT deep and 20% of ENT Focus accounts by 216 end Q1; drive interlock with at least 1 BCAP per Deep account in H1). 2/ SI Partners for migrations & modernization: Key SI and 217 regional consulting Partners provide us scale and execution capabilities for migration & modernization with many also bringing in 218 FSI expertise on applications, process knowhow or security/regulatory compliance capabilities. We will identify 7 priority SI partners 219 (WIP: CXIO, Rackspace, ACC, Lumiq, Quadra, Ganit, Oneture) with who we will drive maximum proactive sales interlocks as well as 220 maximise 1:1 FS LT connect + cadence to build traction for better coverage. 3/ FSI ISV Partners: FSI ISV partners continue to be the 221 backbone of ENT FSIs in India, this motion elaborated in the FSI IGA section. We will also be working closely with 1/2 partners (like 222 TCS) on our Think Big opportunity to enable a DC Exit at large banks, which will require a multi-year transformational approach. 223 JAN 2024 | FY23 OP2 – FSI 
Amazon Confidential  Page 5 of 12 3.2 FSI Industry Solutions IGA Update:  224 FSI Industry solutions IGA objectives: 1/ Identify, Cultivate and Enable FSI ISVs to build cloud enabled Industry Solutions on AWS, 225 and 2/ Joint GTM of these Industry Solutions to drive value to ISV and FSI customers. 226 2023 performance vs. plan: Attainment in 2023 of $1.3M (60%). Gap in attainment due to: 1/ HDFC-CRMNext ($3M ARR) moving 227 to 2024, 2/ HDFC-Mindgate deferment ($1.7M ARR), 3/ ICICI Bank-Intellect Design moving to 2024 ($600K ARR), 4/ PNB-CRMNext 228 moving to 2024 ($600K ARR). These will provide a fast start for 2024. Another learning is the time required to align an ISV. It takes 229 3-5 months and FSI sales cycle is longer (4-6 months). Ramp time for revenue is longer than anticipated. IGA has strengthened our 230 Industry Solutions messaging to customers by bringing the entire gamut of FSI relevant partner products mapped to FSI application 231 landscape. During 2023, IGA team identified 90 ISVs, targeted 55 and connected 45 ISVs across 25+ areas (Appendix 9). Enabled 232 field teams with 14 Path’shala’ sessions, 50+ SA sessions and Joint GTM. This translated into 137 opportunities created across 67 233 unique FSI customers and 56 opportunities launched with ARR value of $4M. Key launched opportunities include CRMNext-Axis 234 Bank, Mindgate-Yes Bank, Pennant-Piramal Finance, Pennant-Avanse Finance, Decimal-AU SFB and Intellect-IDFC First. 235 2024 goals and execution plan: With Dec’23 exit MRR at $297K, we will reach an aggregate $4.9M from beginning till ’24 end. Will 236 need incremental $3.2M to meet the overall 3Y IGA target. Execution Plan to meet this: 1/ Pipeline of $7.4M in place with $1.7M in 237 Bus Val + Tech Val + Committed stage, 2/ We will execute a fast start program to accelerate closure of the opportunities in pipeline: 238 HDFC-CRMNext (first year ARR of $800K), HDFC-Mindgate (ARR $1.7M), Axis Bank-TSYS (ARR $960K), IDFC-Montran ($400K), 3/ We 239 now observe a pattern of deal replication which will support non-linear growth during 2024 e.g. CRMNext (HDFC, Axis, SBI, Canara, 240 PNB, Muthoot, JK Bank), Pennant (Piramal, Avanse, HDFC, Axis Finance, UNO Bank, Unity SFB, Ecofy, Vistaar), Mindgate (HDFC, Yes 241 Bank, IndusInd, RBL, Kotak), Liquitics (Kotak, ICICI, IndusInd, Unity SFB, Bandhan), 4/ In 2024, we will be running with 1.5 HC (1 AM 242 and 1 SA distributed between IGA and FSI accounts). Beyond revenue, IGA has a long-term impact by 1/ gaining mindshare with 243 ISVs to recommend AWS e.g. Mindgate (aligned to Azure earlier) is now AWS-First; CRMNext quoted 4 RFPs with AWS in 2023; 244 Pennant is recommending AWS as preferred partner 2/ identifying niche AWS-ready FSI industry solutions which were out of 245 purview earlier e.g. Liquitics, Coherent Global, VirSoftech, Veefin etc. 3/ entering into industry solution conversation with FSI 246 customers. Our mission is to make this the best FSI sales team in the industry, highly competent in solution-selling to our customers. 247 3.3 Q1’24 Fast Start  248 FSI in 2024, combines ENT FSI and Fintech, will focus on: 1/Account transition plan: New account team introductions and knowledge 249 transfers to be concluded by Jan 31st. 2/ Exec Connect: In order to drive deeper strategic ties and stronger account relationship we 250 will have a connect between Segment leader/ FLM and senior stakeholders of our top 30 accounts (that drive 70% of the revenue) 251 by Q1 and reach top 45 accounts that drive 80% of the revenue by end of H1. 3/ Focus on GenAI : We will explore (5th Feb- 1st Mar) 252 and execute GenAI opportunities in our Top 25 accounts with the support of our SA team with a target to pursue 15 Qualified+ 253 Opps. 4/ Team enablement: To benefit from Industry alignment model we need to train/upskill our team with relevant industry 254 knowledge/ available sales plays. We will work with Field Enablement team and Industry BD/Specialist team to roll out training 255 calendar and enablement for the year. 5/ Partner led Sales play: a/Co sell motion: Drive programmatic (19th Feb -29th Mar) co-sell 256 by focusing on five domains (Storage, Security, Analytics). b/ SRRP Prospecting campaign with 4 identified SRRP partners (PaloAlto, 257 Zscaler, MongoDb, Trendmicro) to build a SRRP pipeline in Q1’24 ($2M creation). 6/ Industry Specific Sales Plays with ISV solutions 258 (CRMNext, Penant, Mindgate) to provide solution-based offering to our customers with a target to create $5 M pipe. 259 4.0 Think Big plan: Build an integrated $1B FSI business (5X growth) by driving deeper penetration  260 Incremental revenue potential of $250M-$300M over 3Y. With rapid digitization of key infrastructure like payments and faster 261 adoption of digital channels like eBanking and Mobile, Banks have had to innovate at a faster pace than ever before to deliver 262 differentiated customer experiences and build higher resiliency on core systems. This has led Banks to embrace technology as a 263 core tenet to drive business outcomes. This has given an opportunity to explore bold DC Exit opportunities at some large banks to 264 drive deeper penetration in FSI ($200M+ ARR, $2.6B TAS across segments). FSI can be an engine of growth for India. While we will 265 continue to engage early to build cloud native solutions with Fintechs, the GTM plan for ENT FSI customers will involve a 4-pronged 266 approach focused on the highest TAS opportunities to build a $1B FSI business. 1/ Data Center (DC) exit program: Currently, only 267 about 10% of core banking/insurance workloads are on the cloud, and targeted DC exits are crucial to increase adoption. We will 268 focus on the top 16 FSI customers across banking (e.g. HDFC, ICICI, SBI, Axis, Yes Bank) & insurance (e.g. Max Life, BAGIC/BALIC, 269 ICICI Prudential Life), and target to win 60% of TAS/$100M+ ARR each, over the next 3Y-5Y (regulatory guidelines mandate a multi-270 cloud approach, thereby limiting penetration). This approach will require sustained CEO level executive engagements, tight 271 #OneAWS execution, & customized incentive programs to build early traction. We will also need to invest in a Business Development 272 team that has experience driving such large-scale DC Exits, including crafting the ideal commercial construct. 2/ Partner with leading 273 ISVs & GSIs to modernize & deploy FSI SaaS solutions: Currently, almost all traditional ENT FSIs leverage core banking applications 274 from GSIs/ISVs (e.g. TCS BaNCS, Infosys/ Finacle, Oracle FlexCube, GroupAsia & LifeAsia from DXC), but these solutions are 275 predominantly on-prem and are heavily dependent on an Oracle stack. This presents an opportunity to migrate & modernize these 276 applications (with support from our WW service teams), while engaging with the FSIs to deploy them, and will require a cohesive, 277 tripartite GTM approach between the ISV/GSIs, the banks and AWS. 3/ Continue engaging with regulators and strengthen AWS’ 278 role in “Make in India”. In addition to focused regulatory engagement to ensure cloud adoption by FSIs is viewed favourably by the 279 JAN 2024 | FY23 OP2 – FSI 
Amazon Confidential  Page 6 of 12 regulators, we need to build evidence for AWS’ role in the “Make in India” narrative beyond having local data centers (e.g., MSFT-280 Jio, OCI-Airtel), given the focus on self-reliance and an India Cloud. The Indian government is actively considering its options for a 281 “sovereign cloud”, to have more strategic control over cloud providers providing infrastructure to public sector and regulated 282 industries. Partnering with a reputed conglomerate like TATA Sons to build such an “India Cloud” offering will be crucial to ensure 283 AWS continues to be a player in the Indian FS industry. [Ask]:1/  Investment in a senior project management headcount to build 284 and manage an execution plan, including driving partner conversations, in collaboration with the PSM and GSI teams.2/ AWS WW 285 and APJ leadership commitment to drive regular (twice a year, once the project is conceptualized) interactions with CEOs of at least 286 4 banks (SBI, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank). A T2T2T (that includes partner CEO connect) will be crucial to accelerate such a 287 bold initiative in India, where cloud adoption in Banking is still very nascent.3/ A strategic partnership with a conglomerate like 288 TATA sons, to drive India Cloud offerings. 4/ Drive momentum in Public Sector Banks ($700M TAS): India has 10 Public sector Banks 289 (PSB) who contribute to 48% of the Retail-MSME credit market in India. Out of these, 6 PSBs will covered as Deep accounts (2 290 engaged – SBI, Canara; and 4 GF – BOB, PNB, BOI, UBI). The PSBs are publicly listed for-profit commercial organizations, but with 291 government shareholding, have unique organization structures (most top execs have a lifetime tenure at PSBs), complex & 292 consensus driven decision-making processes (via strictly defined RFP processes) and have traditionally been slow to adopt any new 293 technology compared to Private sector Banks in India (we est. a 18-24 months lag in tech adoption). However, with Private Banks 294 on a firm journey to public cloud adoption with material workloads, we have seen early signs of interest from PSBs to get started. 295 We will drive momentum in this sector to deliver ~4M in 2024 and $60M over 5 years. A detailed write-up on PSB is in Appendix 6. 296 5.0 Summary of key risks, dependencies and asks (beyond the asks for Big Bets): 297 1/ Constant Currency offerings for 5 years. As evidenced in the conversations with CAMS, HDFC Life (and it is expected to be an ask 298 by Public Sector Banks, as we make inroads), a 5-year INR pricing commercial construct is increasingly becoming critical to win in 299 India. 2/ In order to drive more revenue, expedite availability of MP and other strategic services (like Gen AI) in India. 3/ Competitive 300 ProServe pricing (as compared to other CSPs and large GSIs) will become a key requirement to move business critical workloads to 301 AWS at large FSIs. Indian FSIs, who are yet to become proficient builders, frequently require OEM skin in the game for mission 302 critical projects. Anecdotal feedback suggests we can be up to 2x competition currently, which is not scalable. This will also be 303 critical to win more standalone ProServe opportunities vs relying too heavily on PPA Attach. ProServe should also have the same 304 funding levers that are available for partners, to ensure parity 4/ Marketing: (a) Adequate funding for in-account initiatives for Deep 305 and some Focus-Select accounts.(b) An in-person FSI Forum for the top 25-30 FSI (across Enterprise and Fintech) stakeholders, to 306 enable networking, share learnings, deepen CXO connects and showcase our large transformation successes. 5/ Incremental 307 headcount: (a)  Specialist BD/SA pod for Gen AI and 1 Specialist BD/SA pod for Data/ Analytics, dedicated to FSI.(b) Incremental SA 308 coverage of 8 SAs (3 for Deep, 3 for Fintech, 1 for Focus and 1 for FSI ISV) to ensure adequate coverage (c) Dedicated program 309 manager to support FSI initiatives. 6/ Increased CSM coverage for all MAP 2.0 across Deep and Focus; CSM for every Deep account 310 billing more than $5M ARR. 7/ SSOE support to operationalize revenue sharing across FSI and ISV/SUP teams to drive better 311 collaboration between the teams. 8/ A specific comp for Public sector Banks in Deep Sales motion. These banks will take 2-3 years 312 to ramp-up owing to the slow bureaucratic processes in these organizations. Requesting a 2-3 year sales plan for AMs covering 313 Banks like SBI, Canara Bank, that are no longer in Greenfield as group entities are billing with AWS. Greenfield tag is assessed at the 314 parent level, leading to these 0 biller banks to not be eligible for a Greenfield compensation plan. 9/ TAS data used for segmentation 315 has data errors (e.g. IndusInd Bank, the 5th largest private sector bank, is shown with $11M TAS, while its microfinance subsidiary, 316 Bharat Financial, is show to have $29M TAS). Inaccuracies in TAS data has led to 2 large accounts moving to Scale (e.g. Indian 317 Overseas Bank, Indian Bank are among the top 10 Public sector banks in the country). Request for a window to correct these errors 318 for some obvious accounts. 319 6.0 Conclusion: 320 2023 was a challenging year for FSI. There have been multiple headwinds like intense focus on CO (over 50% of customers), loss of 321 a large account like Dhani (introduced a gap of $3.2M), Zscaler claw back of $3.8M (Full year) and some significant disruptive events 322 in the Fintech segment (covered earlier in the doc). However, there are significant tailwinds and FSI continues to be in a position to 323 drive good growth, if some big bets materialize and some of the regulatory and policy uncertainties are solved for. We also expect 324 a resurgence of the Fintech sector in 18-24 months time, when more investments are likely to come into this sector. We strongly 325 believe we will continue to outpace the India growth rate in this segment, and can move the integrated Enterprise and Fintech 326 vertical to a 30%+ growth in the next 24 months. The team enjoys high Earn Trust with customer stakeholders across all sub-327 verticals. We will continue to be intentional about retaining that trust. Senior stakeholders from 2 large banks remarked that they 328 have never seen any other technology vendor provide such support.  329 7.0 Frequently Asked Questions 330 7.1 What “dogs not barking” worry you?  331 1/ Ambiguity around Regulatory/ Policy direction around India Cloud and the ability to host business critical workloads on US HQed 332 CSPs (NSE who have scaled down their cloud footprint). Currently, UIDAI is not approving the use of cloud for Aadhar Vault and 333 AUA/KUA services. 2/ A push by regulators to explore cloud ready and CSP agnostic solutions, potentially slowing the down the 334 JAN 2024 | FY23 OP2 – FSI 
Amazon Confidential  Page 7 of 12 adoption of our cloud native services, the core of our modernization strategy. We continue to work closely with the PP team on 335 both topics. We will need a concerted effort, in collaboration with PS teams, to address the same.  336 7.2 How are competitors innovating in your area?  337 Competitors are relying on aggressive discounts to win targeted workloads (E.g. GCP at HDFC Ergo) rather than Innovation, with the 338 exception of the OpenAI partnership of MS. Early availability of Gen AI offerings in India (E.g. Vertex AI and Open AI) have provided 339 them a head start with FSI customers, with early whitelisting. We need Bedrock availability in India in early Q1’24. We will leverage 340 the GenAI Innovation Center as a strategic tool to drive business outcomes at large customers. 341 7.3 Which industry vertical initiatives are critical for growth acceleration? What support do you need from BDSI specialists?  342 Growth in Banking, and Retention in Fintech will be key factors to drive growth in FSI. We’ll need BDSI expertise to drive 343 transformational DC exit programs. Continued support of BDSI specialists in Deep and Focus Select will be needed to drive 344 conversations with LoB leaders. BDSI support will also be needed to establish AWS as a thought leader in driving business outcomes 345 in FSI through Industry events and supporting regional and WW CxO initiatives. This is required to bring global learnings to India as 346 well as offer a platform for Indian leaders to showcase their success globally. 347 Appendices 348 Appendix 1: Overview of FSI segment split 349

Amazon Confidential  Page 9 of 12 - Database ($24.7M ARR 2023 YTD, 10% YoY), Containers ($17.5M ARR 2023 YTD, 14% YoY), Analytics ($8.67M ARR 2023 YTD, -4% 362 YoY), AI/ML ($0.61M ARR 2023 YTD, 24% YoY). Key thematic areas of our wins and losses are: a) Containers:  We are able to influence 363 our customers to adopt containers (running on Graviton chips and spot instances) as infrastructure choice to optimize costs and 364 improve utilization. E.g. Upstox migrated their order management platform on EKS with Karpenter ($0.3M YTD Nov, 74% YoY), PayU 365 launched Thought Machine - a Core Banking application on EKS ($0.42M YTD Nov, 61% YoY), CoinDCX launched their DeFi/CeFI on 366 EKS  with Karpenter ($0.6M YTD Nov, 682% YoY), Paytm migrated and re-architected their Auth application from Ali-cloud to EKS 367 ($0.8M YTD Nov, 55% YoY), Polygon re-architected their monolith applications running on EC2 to ECS utilizing Fargate ($0.63M YTD 368 Nov, 2796% YoY). b) Databases: For relational use-cases such as transactional consistency, better performance and scalability, un-369 differentiated heavy lifting of database management and DR capabilities (with Aurora), customers such as Paytm, PayU, BharatPe, 370 Upstox, Razorpay continue to scale on RDS (especially RDS Aurora), thus driving the usage. For NoSQL use-cases, ‘Key-Value pair’ 371 requirement is the most sought after and is extensively used in use-cases such as data-store for micro-services, other applications 372 which can work with eventual consistency model. For such use-cases, Dynamo DB is preferred by customers such as Paytm (Ads 373 team), PayU, CoinDCX due to its performance and serverless architecture. Besides Dynamo DB, we’re also seeing interest from 374 Fintech customers such as Polygon technology, PayU, Navi Technology, Paytm for storing JSON data as documents, thus driving up 375 the utilization of Document DB. c) Analytics: Customers such as Navi Technologies, Paytm, PayU, Slice, Polygon have continued to 376 build and scale their data pipelines using Lakehouse architecture which has driven the usage of Amazon Managed Streaming for 377 Kafka ($1.3M YTD Nov, 36% YoY), EMR ($2.2M YTD Nov, 55% YoY) and Athena ($0.55M YTD Nov, 1% YoY). Slice, a fintech major in 378 Lending business have migrated from Databricks to EMR (#winback from compete ISVs, contributing to EMR ) as EMR is able to 379 offer a better price to performance and more choices of run-times (such as Flink, Trino). Customers undertook various optimization 380 activities on their OpenSearch clusters e.g. archival/periodic maintenance of data, graviton adoption, node re-sizing which led to 381 reduction of OpenSearch usage (and hence 18% YoY drop in revenue). Redshift usage also contracted ($1.17M YTD Nov, -36% YoY) 382 as customers moved to Lakehouse architecture 383 Appendix 5: Gen AI update: 384 Across traditional FSI enterprises, 34 GenAI sessions across 23 FSI customers were conducted. These sessions were attended by 385 600+ attendees and received an avg CSAT of 4.5/5. Apart from customer sessions, 2 enablement sessions conducted for field teams 386 covering the basics of Gen AI, AWS services positioning, demos, industry use cases and partners to engage. These sessions led to 387 discussion of 22 customer uses cases across various customers across 11 FSI customers, among which 5 POCs are currently in 388 progress. Based on the POC discussions 22 customer influences for Amazon Bedrock availability in BOM region were created 389 influencing $517K. SA team has 3 GenAI ambassadors and co-owned the AWS Generative AI Hackathon Playbook . This document 390 helped the SA team conduct 14 Workshops / Hackathons (including Axis Bank) across multiple customers across India and attended 391 by 1200+ participants. Details can be found in https://quip-amazon.com/ZgCoAatZU0yb/AWS-Generative-AI-Hackathon-Playbook-392 for-ENT. There has been executive engagement with service teams at Axis Bank (Bedrock, Kendra & Plato), HDFC Bank (Gen AI 393 focussed EBC), BFL (Gen AI focussed EBC). This has led to PoCs at all these customers, Axis Bank PoC is in progress & at other 394 customers in discussion.  395 Enterprise Wins - From customer adoption of AWS GenAI services, GaadiBazaar (NLP powered query) is in CUG, MaxLife 396 (conversational bot for agents) has been rolled out to be used by 1000 support agents (Winner in AI Conclave) and ICICI Lombard 397 has deployed 2 uses case (Chatbots) in Pre-prod.  Additionally, we have got one of our Focus customers - Fincare Small Finance 398 Bank experimenting with Claude and Titan and will go live in Q1 24 ($100k) 399 Across Fintech : Across 4 deep accounts (Paytm, Quadeye Securities, Razorpay, Cred) - we’ve done 10+ sessions with these 400 customers covering technical topics such as Sagemaker Jumpstart, CodeWhisperer, Bedrock, recently launched services Amazon Q, 401 QuickSight Q (done at Paytm only) resulting in a) Paytm evaluating Sagemaker Jumpstart, Bedrock for use-cases such as 402 Personalised QR generation, document Q&A to improve the productivity of operations team and            Code Whisperer b) Razorpay 403 has successfully completed a PoC of Amazon Bedrock (using Claude V2) to build a merchant assistance bot which will replace a 404 similar bot built with OpenAI. Razorpay is moving out of OpenAI due to better pricing of ClaudeV2 when compared to OpenAI. 405 Razorpay is also evaluating Amazon              Bedrock (Claude) vs OpenAI to create an automated data-dictionary for Data-406 warehousing tables. c) Happay, part of Cred, is evaluating Amazon Bedrock (Claude V2) to build an expense management 407 application. We’ve partnered with WWSO team to drive these GenAI engagements which included activities such as - customer 408 leadership engagement to create mindshare on AWS services, in-account developer engagement thru GenAI hackathons 409 (conducted in 1 each at Paytm and Razorpay), customer enablement, support in technical evaluation of AWS GenAI services and 410 engagement with WW GenAI team. Thru our activities in these accounts, we’ve been able to secure the sponsorship of key customer 411 stakeholders such as CTO, Head of Data Science.  412 Fintech Wins: Our activities in 2023 has resulted in 2 GenAI launches at Paytm. a) Launch of personalised QR code in Paytm app 413 using Stable Diffusion to celebrate Indian Independence Day (ARR $60K) b) Rent agreement analysis using Textract, Sagemaker 414 Jumpstart (Cohere Generate Model - Command) for text summarization, Q&A (ARR $66K).  415 JAN 2024 | FY23 OP2 – FSI 
Amazon Confidential  Page 10 of 12 Challenges/Learnings: a) To comply with data residency requirements, fintech customers are seeking Bedrock availability in BOM 416 region. Additionally, for Bedrock BOM region launch we would need feature parity with N. Virginia region viz. Agents, Knowledge 417 Base as customers like Paytm are seeking these features (PFR link from Paytm account)  b) Prompt engineering in Bedrock is 418 verbose when compared with OpenAI e.g. in situations wherein calculations need to be done, OpenAI can invoke external agents 419 seamlessly without end users doing prompt engineering (such as agents and tools). Customer developers have also mentioned to 420 us that with OpenAI, there is a plethora of tutorials/online guides available. Claude has limited amount of prompt engineering 421 (and other help guides) available and at times this has become a blocker during evaluation stages c) For certain use-cases, we’ve 422 found that OpenAI is able to provide better prediction accuracy when compared with Bedrock e.g. at Razorpay for multi-lingual 423 Auto-eKYC use-case, OpenAI was found to provide a better prediction accuracy when compared to Claude on Amazon Bedrock d) 424 We’ve not been successful in helping our customer adopt Code Whisperer in compete against Github Co-pilot. Feedbacks 425 received – 1/ The number of English words needed by CodeWhisperer to  generate working code sample is verbose when 426 compared to Github Co-pilot  2/ Code Whisperer had been un-able to scan existing code repositories thereby   limiting the 427 developers’ ability to use in daily situations. In FY24, we will re-engage our customers on Code Whisperer basis of the reinvent 428 launches. 429 Appendix 6: Think Big for Public Sector Banks: 430 Plan for 2024: India has 10 Public sector Banks (PSB) who contribute to 48% of the Retail-MSME credit market in India. Out of these, 431 6 PSBs will covered as Deep accounts (2 engaged – SBI, Canara; and 4 GF – BOB, PNB, BOI, UBI), with a combined estimated TAS of 432 ~$900M. The PSBs are publicly listed for-profit commercial organizations, but with government shareholding, have unique 433 organization structures (most top execs have a lifetime tenure at PSBs), complex & consensus driven decision-making processes 434 (via strictly defined RFP processes) and have traditionally been slow to adopt any new technology compared to Private sector Banks 435 in India (we est. a 18-24 months lag in tech adoption). However, with Private Banks on a firm journey to public cloud adoption with 436 material workloads, we have seen early signs of interest from PSBs to get started. Some key beachheads, we currently have in PSBs 437 include Co-lending platform at SBI (Yubi), Canara (SFDC SRRP win via RFP), PNB (CRMNext win, $3M/5Y), UBI (VMCA for T&D, $650K 438 ARR committed stage), Central Bank Housing Finance ($200K ARR), SBI GIC ($3.6M/3Y PPA), Canara HSBC ($200K ARR), etc. To put 439 them on a firm path to AWS cloud, we will drive the following key initiatives in 2024: 1/ Building a security & compliance foundation: 440 In 2024, we will focus on building a strong security & compliance foundation helping build awareness across security and other 441 teams, and help them better understand the operational controls needed on AWS to meet their regulatory needs. This should 442 culminate in building a landing zone across these Banks. Landing zone plans have already been kickstarted at SBI with discussions 443 in progress at PNB and UBI; 2/ Building executive sponsorship for Cloud adoption: by engaging CIOs and Executive Directors (EDs 444 are function heads who report into MDs) to build mindshare drive specific call-to-actions of identifying the first set of workloads to 445 be migrated 3/ Joint account planning with key ISVs: Work on joint account planning with key strategic ISVs such as CRMNext, SFDC, 446 Nucleus, Lentra, Newgen, Finacle, Mindgate, TCS Bancs, Workapps, etc. E.g.: This has helped us identify opportunities in SBI, PNB, 447 Canara, etc. with two key wins (with CRMNext at PNB, $3M/5yr; and SFDC at Canara Bank) 4/ Align with incumbent and challenger 448 GSIs/Large SI partners (atleast 2 per account): All PSBs have major GSIs as their outsourcing partners. PSBs typically award end-to-449 end RFPs for specific applications/initiatives on a turnkey basis for 5/ 7 years including implementation and managed services to an 450 SI/GSIs. Early alignment will help us engage/identify early Pre-RFP stage opportunities. 6/ Skilling and enablement: Given their low 451 Cloud awareness levels, we will work to drive both broad based and executive skilling and enablement initiatives across these 452 accounts including leveraging marketing (ABM). 7/ Focus on Banking Subsidiaries for In-year growth: PSBs have Insurance, cards, 453 securities, NBFC or wealth mgmt. subsidiaries who generally have more autonomy in decision making (relative to the Parent Bank) 454 due to their governance structure and smaller size. Some subsidiaries such as Canara HSBC, SBI GIC, etc. have already started on 455 Cloud/AWS with key applications, giving us an opportunity to accelerate them in 2024. Tactically, the above key initiatives will be 456 captured in an account plan collaborating with extended teams to drive our alignment and focus. We will also engage external 457 influencers and bodies such as IBA (Indian Banking Association, which is dominated by PSB members) to drive thought leadership 458 (E.g.: participating in industry events such as IBA Awards & pursue joint publishing of whitepapers) or one-to-many 459 initiatives/workshops on Cloud transformation. The key sales plays will include: a/ ISV aligned sales play; b/ Data platforms, 460 regulatory reporting & ML; c/ Security and threat intelligence solutions to engage CISO offices; d/ VMCA, as a point of entry for 461 T&D, peripheral workloads (replicate the win with UBI, $650K ARR) e/ Digital Banking (a big investment area for PSBs as they try to 462 raise their digital customer experiences to become on-par with Private Banks); f/ Co-lending and Agri lending solutions play: PSBs 463 have a lion’s share of Agri & ‘priority sector’ lending market India. We believe, our increased investments into PSBs from 2024 464 coupled with the specific strategies listed about should set us on path to unlock their potential and drive accelerated growth to 10X 465 to an est. ~27.5M ARR by FY27 (from <$2.3M in2023). 466 JAN 2024 | FY23 OP2 – FSI

For the Focus cohort of accounts, 474 marketing will focus on mapping industry and LoB use cases, identify 1P + 3P solutions to address them, and curate localized GTM 475 activities. Our effort is to prioritize FSI deep accounts and high value Fintech/ Enterprise Focus accounts by a) Driving a retention 476 play with Top 20 customers (69% of segment revenue) with curated interventions like ABM in account events, FSI dedicated track 477 in Summit, FSI only ExecLeaders, bigger participation in the Fintech forum, higher representation at re:Invent and EBC roaster. b) 478 Building growth plays for Next 43 accounts (Focus Select, 19% of FSI revenue) through India properties like FSI Conclave (25+ CXOs 479 and 250+ITDM audience), Customer events like Razorpay FTX, industry association/Analyst events (Gartner/IBA/ IDC), CxO Forum 480 engagements in partnership with ISV (Lentra) and community led engagements like FSI Tech Leaders Assembly (ITDMs focused). c) 481 Driving Scale Enablement Motions for Focus core will happen primarily via digital properties i.e. APJ led digital programs like 482 innovate, webinars, virtual account workshops and selective 3rd party industry events like IDG100, ET BFSI forum, CNBC Gen AI 483 forum. We will also accelerate our efforts on building brand plays with leading publishers especially for FSI. We have to scale our 484 FSI References by >2X. While we have had 10+ referenceable assets created in the last 12 months (HDFC Life/Axis Bank), we need 485 to double down on case studies as FSI customers take longer to approve case studies/ PTI articles. We did 5 written FSI case studies 486 in last 12 months (Freecharge, Paytm, Setu)  and have  additional 3 case studies in progress( SBI Life, Max Life & HDFC) 487 Appendix 8: Cross-service PPA in Fintech 488 Account Name Term Length Deal Expiration Date  TCV Paytm Mobile Solutions Pvt.

Amazon Confidential  Page 1 of 12 The purpose of this document is to give the reader an overview of the Financial Services business in India, some context around the 1 India nuances, key macro factors that are driving behaviour around cloud adoption, plans for FY24 and our big bets. 2 Vision: FSI vision is to be the ‘Transformation Partner’ of choice for the FSI Industry and a catalyst for cultural transformation and 3 Innovation. We want to be the largest CSP (primary/ preferred cloud provider) for the top 10 customers in Banking, Insurance, 4 Capital Markets and NBFC. Currently, we are meaningfully engaged at 7/10 Private sector banks (largest CSP at 4), top 9 insurers 5 (both life and non-life insurance companies, largest at 7) and 14 of 16 non-banking financial companies. We plan to enable Fintechs 6 to become the preferred rails for "Digital Public Infrastructure", while increasing our wallet share further to 85%+, from the current 7 79%. In the next 5 years, we aspire to build this into a $1B business. 8 1.0 Business Overview: 9 1.1 Historical trends, TAS, view of Greenfield, Net new vs. Recurring: 10 Financial Services segment covers ~$3B in TAS. Banking sub-segment is 11 by-far the largest with low penetration, which gives a significant 12 runway for growth, with the right regulatory conditions. 11% of these 13 accounts are Greenfield, representing 20% of the TAS. A big percentage 14 of this is in Public Sector Banks. The adjacent table gives a breakdown 15 of accounts covered in each segment, the associated GAR and TAS. A 16 deeper strategy to grow this segment is covered in our Think Big Plan. 17 Note: TAS data used for segmentation has data errors (e.g. Web3 applications, which represent Crypto, GAR is more than TAS). For the sake of consistency, we have used the same data 18 used for segmentation. Directionally, the spread of TAS and the overall numbers are realistic and should give a good idea of the industry. 19 1.2 Headwinds/ Tailwinds: 20 There are significant tailwinds in Banking, where rapid growth in digital payments and adoption of digital channels (post Covid) is 21 driving digital transformation projects across the industry. This largely drove the Fintech growth over the last few years, helped by 22 the exponential growth in UPI (digital B2C and C2C/P2P payments). UPI volume in Dec 2023 touched $208B (11.4B transactions). 23 UPI volume has grown at a CAGR of 168% from 2017-18 from $12B to $1.7T. Banks are increasingly looking at Cloud-first strategies 24 to drive Innovation as well as build resiliency and scalability for highly volatile workloads like payments. Indian FS market is still 25 largely underserved (only ~70% of Indians have Bank accts, with credit & insurance at <10% penetration), which provides a large 26 runway for growth for FS industry in India, beyond the current TAS. Large Private sector FS players are investing in modernizing 27 platforms to plan capacity for future growth driven by favourable demographics, and increasingly looking at cloud-native 28 architectures to drive business agility or lower costs (E.g.: Postgres is becoming the first choice over Oracle for CX workloads). Banks 29 are investing in in-house build capabilities esp. for Digital platforms, which positions AWS favourably due to our developer & startup 30 ecosystem in India. There are a few headwinds that might slow down revenue growth that are 31 largely uncontrollable. 1/ Cost. There is an intense focus on Cost Optimization as customers try to 32 put more governance on cloud costs. Cheap labour costs and favourable on-prem pricing is not 33 enabling a significant price differential in the early stages of the cloud journey. Traditional and 34 new players, like Adani and Jio, are coming up with competitive price-points for FS customers to 35 continue investing on-prem. 2/ Geo-political/ Regulatory uncertainty. Inconsistent policies (E.g. 36 Central Banking Digital Currency not allowed to go on public cloud; SEBI, Securities Regulator, has been sending mixed messages in 37 private conversations with regulated entities on moving critical workloads to public cloud) have created ambiguity and hence 38 cautiousness in any rapid movement to the cloud. RBI (Banking regulator) has also recently indicated an intent to offer its own cloud 39 facility for hosting critical workloads. Geo-political risks and an implicit nudge for an India cloud (owned/operated by an Indian 40 company) option is increasing complexity. NBFCs have also come under intense regulatory scrutiny and have been restricted to 41 grow some aspects (like lending). 3/ FX volatility is driving demand for INR pricing. 4/ Funding winter is expected to continue for 42 most of 2024. 2023 saw a precipitous drop in funding from $9.6B in 2021, $6B in 2022 to $2.1B in 2023 (Source: Tracxn), leading to 43 muted growth expectation of Fintech revenue in 2024. Crypto industry is also on the decline owing to regulatory ambiguity (Crypto 44 customers have already reduced usage by an avg. 12% in 2023). 5/ Increase in competitive activity, who are trying to reduce the 45 gap with aggressive pricing options, and INR pricing. Most Indian FSIs are India-focused and don’t have a large multinational 46 engagement. They don’t have a FX risk from their core business and do not want that to be introduced because of their IT spend. 47 1.3 Cloud/customer/segment maturity  48 Banks will continue to provide the largest runway for growth (45% of FSI TAS, 4% wallet share in terms of GAR), as seen in section 49 1.1. The journey started in 2020 and only private sector banks have begun their move to the cloud over the last 3 years. Public 50 Sector Banks (~$700M+ TAS) are poised to begin their journey this year and will be a Think Big bet for driving FS growth. Most 51 private sector insurers (e.g. ICICI Lombard, HDFC Life, BAGIC) and Capital Markets (e.g. Angel One, Motilal Oswal, HDFC AMC) 52 entities have moved most workloads to the cloud through Lift+Shift migrations. Modernization and migration of core systems, 53 Innovation, Data modernization, Gen AI will be key focus in these sectors. Private sector banks continue to be large buyers of ISV 54 solutions but are also starting to transform themselves into builders (e.g. HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, Kotak Bank), starting with CX and 55 Sub-Segment# AccountsTTM GAR$TASGAR % TASBanking53$56,276,852$1,302,471,8444%NBFC31$14,596,645$534,057,5403%Insurance41$35,987,140$450,006,8998%Payments64$200,910,108$356,767,63456%Capital Markets/Securities55$53,861,145$243,787,84822%Financial Services - Other13$6,983,625$17,955,57739%Web3 Apps (Crypto)5$18,408,776$17,560,996105%Software2$956,871$1,588,17060%Grand Total264$387,981,163$2,924,196,50813%

They are builders who are driving Innovation through technology.  57 1.4 Market segment positioning / Noteworthy 2023 progress/successes 58 2023 was a year of many firsts including large PPA’s with 2 of the Top 3 private sector Banks (HDFC Bank: $80M/5Y; Axis Bank: 59 $90M/5Y– largest for any CSP in India Enterprise FSI); Large SRRP deals with Zscaler at HDFC Bank (TCV: $40M/5Y) and ICICI Bank 60 (TCV: $62M/6Y), first Salesforce SRRP deal in AWS India at HDFC Bank, Deployment of secondary envt of CRMNext at Axis Bank. We 61 also saw acceleration of modernization of core workloads (e.g. TCS BaNCS Policy Administration System at SBI  GIC, and core digital 62 platforms like Optimus, Mobile+ Net banking, at IDFC First Bank, Thought Machine, Core Banking for new digital products, at IDFC 63 First and PayU). In Analytics, Amazon Redshift became a platform of choice at Angel One, Kotak Bank and Motilal Oswal. With 64 Fintech customers, there was significant progress around  1/ Graviton adoption (improved from ~5.5% in Jan-23 to 8.9% in Nov-23) 65 2/ Improved PPA  Coverage from 79%  to 86% of 2023 revenue; 24 (out of 52) customers under PPA. Wins: PayU ($60M/3Y), 66 Razorpay ($50M/3Y), Navi ($20M/5Y), and Bharatpe ($18M/3Y); 3/ Enterprise Support Penetration: 16 (out of top 20) on ES with 3 67 net-new wins in 2023. YTD Nov, strategic services adoption by Fintechs have grown 17% (~$54M in 2022 to ~$63M in 2023).   68 1.5 What is the 3Y/5Y vision? What will you be doing in 2024 to get closer to that vision? 69 We aspire to grow the FSI business to $1B in 5 years. Beyond the BAU Sales plays, we will continue to focus on the FSI Industry 70 Solutions IGA to drive business outcomes on AWS; deepen our Fintech engagement, increasing our wallet share by driving more 71 Pan-Amazon synergies and hence stickiness to AWS; making big bets around Public Sector Banks ($700M+ TAS) and 72 transformational DC Exits in a few large Private Sector banks, to drive significant growth in 3-5 years. Details in Think Big section.  73 2.0 FY23 Summary, observations, and learnings 74 2.1 Overall performance - vertical/segment 75 As highlighted in section 1.2, the 76 Banking segment is driving a healthy 77 growth ($53M, 68% Nov’23 YTD, YoY) 78 as the largest private sector banks 79 adopt a cloud first strategy to drive 80 Innovation, deliver better CX. Banks 81 have taken a measured approach to cloud adoption and have not embarked on large lift and shift initiatives. Instead, they are taking 82 a modernization approach to determine which applications need to be moved to the cloud. As applications have gotten complex 83 (like CRM, Loan management systems), the project and sales life cycles have increased (by 14-16%), leading to a slower growth rate 84 than years past (where growth was driven by non-critical applications). Public Sector Banks have just begun to consider cloud for 85 some of their transformation initiatives. We won the first few opportunities (CRMNext at Punjab National Bank, $3M/5Y) and Union 86 Bank of India ($600K ARR) that will begin their deployment journey in 2024. Insurance continues to have mixed growth ($28M, 17% 87 Nov’23 YTD, YoY) with some large accounts HDFC Life ($4.7M , -5% Nov’23 YTD YoY), BAGIC+BALIC ($2.65M, 14% Nov’23 YTD YoY), 88 ICICI Pru Life ($2.2M, 4% Nov’23 YTD YoY), in the final stages of their migrations. The current growth is being driven by core 89 modernization and data initiatives at Acko General Insurance ($2.1M, 86% Nov’23 YTD YoY), Max Life ($2.2M, 27% Nov’23 YTD YoY), 90 Star Health, ($1.3M, 52% Nov’23 YTD YoY). Capital Markets (50% YoY), with seen strong growth in 6 of the top 8 accounts, driven 91 by new app development and data initiatives at Angel Broking ($7M, 61% Nov’23 YTD YoY), DC Exit at HDFC AMC ($1.1M , 336% 92 Nov’23 YTD YoY). Fintech overall has slowed down due to the funding winter, as evidenced in section 1.2. E.g.: Razorpay (Usage -93 10% YoY), Cred ( -8%), Upstox (-19%), Simpl (-17%). However, the trends are mixed with sectors like Capital Markets (Quadeye: 94 +112%, Zerodha-32%), Digital Lending (Navi:+183%, Truebalance:+147%), and Insurtech (Acko:+77% Policy Bazar:+32%) have seen 95 growth while others like Crypto (Industry:-21%), and Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL, Slice:- 17%) have declined. Fintech customers like 96 Quadeye grew by entering new markets; Payments startups were focused on cross/upselling to their existing customers. E.g.: Navi 97 entered into insurance, mutual funds & wealth management and Zerodha diversified into fund management. Paytm growth was 98 also aided by consolidation of workloads on to AWS (~$10M ARR), from regions outside India. Apart from shutting down non-99 profitable business, Fintechs have also taken hard measures such as RIF(Reductions in workforce) e.g.: Cred (35%), PayU (6%), 100 Polygon (20%), CoinDCX (25%) to increase the runway in their business.  101 2.2 Key callouts on team structure, tenure, culture, diversity, connections scores, hiring, RA/URA 102 The FS team comprises of 38 resources (35 BIS), which includes 3 FLMs (tenure ranging from 6-10 years at 103 Amazon); 33 ICs (30 BIS, 3 Women); 1 FSI ISV BD and 1 Program Manager. 39% of the team is less than 2 years 104 at Amazon, while 42% of the team is over 4 years at Amazon, making it a healthy mix of relatively new and 105 tenured Amazonians. Diversity Ratio needs to be improved and we will be intentional in the hiring of TBHs. There 106 are also 2 employees currently on Pivot and 1 employee (RA) serving a notice period. All managers are new to 107 their teams and connection score are not available, right now, that reflects the sentiment of the new org. FSI org 108 has 4 L5s, 24 L6s and 7 L7s, apart from 3 L7Ms as FLMs. The 3 FLMs have 9 (ENT FSI Focus), 10 (Fintech) and 13 (ENT FSI Deep) as 109 span of controls. FSI Segment leader will have 6 people reporting directly as outlined at the beginning of this section, with the 110 addition of the AM for SBI, who will report directly for span of control purposes.

We have been intentional about our team’s wellbeing/development and 112 executing it through 3 pillars 1/FSI Weekly Connect: We bring the FSI sellers together every week to collaborate with functional 113 teams like Partner, ProServe, Training, Marketing team etc. to make our FSI customer successful in their cloud journey. 2/FSI 114 Falcons: FSI AMs, SAs and BDSI teams come together monthly to learn and share insights on new use cases deployed, customer 115 innovations, Progress made with our FSI customers and go deep with some of marquee wins and solutions to make it a repeatable. 116 We will continue both of these engagements in FY24. 3/Upskilling and Career Development: We initiated the ENT Enablement 117 Friday series in 2023 to upskill/enable our team on themes like FSI Specific solutions/ offerings, Industry Specific solutions, Strategic 118 Services, Executive Engagement and Sales Skills sessions led by FE and Industry teams. In FY24, we will plan 20 such enablement 119 workshops and drive programs like FSI/Fintech Ready Program GenAI Refresher Program, Growth Mindset Program. FSI Path’shala’ 120 is a monthly enablement mechanism where we invite strategic ISVs to present their FSI Industry Solutions and USPs. Objective is to 121 equip AWS account teams with functional understanding of the solution and be able to make an initial pitch to FSI customers. Last 122 year we conducted 15 FSI Path'shala sessions and this year we plan to conduct 20. 123 2.3 Successes / performance outcomes against strategy (strategic services) 124 Migrations, Data/ Analytics/ AIML, ISV solutions were key sales plays in 2023. ISV progress is covered in the IGA update. Migrations 125 continue to work well, driving good growth in ENT FSI. Against a 2023 stretch target of $36M migration ARR, we have closed 21 126 (30% of ENT) MAPs with a migration ARR of $51.4M (143% of stretch target). Major migration wins have been from Insurance ( 6 127 out of 21 wins) and Banks (9 out of 21 wins) and rest from NBFC (4, including 1 from Bajaj Finance Ltd, Microsoft’s largest NBFC 128 account), Capital markets(2). In the Fintech space, we have identified 5 Migration prospects (Phone pay, Billdesk, Paisa Bazaar, 129 Wimbo, CC Avenue)  with $25M TAS in our cohort where we plan to close min 2 MAP wins ($3M) in 2024 and acquire all 5 customers 130 ($20M) by FY26. The FSI AI/ML revenue grew by 16% ($1.85M, Nov’23 YTD), driven by 27% growth in the Fintech segment ($785K 131 Nov’23 YTD), led by Paytm ($380K Nov’23 YTD, 100% YoY). The FSI Ent segment grew at 10%($1.3M Nov’23 YTD) owing to degrowth 132 in IDFC First Bank (Nov YTD, $572K, -17% YoY, owing to EDP and Sagemaker Savings plan discounts) and RBL Bank ($90K Nov’23 133 YTD, -52% YoY, due to reduced experimentation and stopping usage of Transcribe). The Analytics revenue grew by 25% ($17.8M, 134 Nov’23 YTD), driven by a 76% growth in FSI Ent segment ($7M, Nov’23 YTD) led by Angel Broking ($1.1M, Nov’23 YTD, 313% YTD, 135 YoY). 2023 saw a healthy 75% Partner attach rate for the Ent FSI segment, up from 70% in 2022, led by collaboration with GSI’s like 136 Deloitte (Indusind Bank, Axis Bank), Accenture (AU Small Finance Bank), TCS (Max Life). In FY’23 YTD (till Oct’23), strategic services 137 contribution to Fintech accounts contribution has increased by 9% (2023 YTD at $51.5M vs FY22 YTD at $47.5M); Database is at 138 $24.7M 2023 YTD, 10% YoY, Containers  at $17.5M 2023 YTD, 14% YoY, Analytics at $8.67M 2023 YTD, -4% YoY and AI/ML is at 139 $0.61M 2023 YTD, 24% YoY.

We have since 145 reworked our forecasts, identified 146 opportunities, worked on pipeline targets for a 147 Fast start (see Appendix 2), factored early outcomes of some Big Bets (FSI ISV, PSB) which now translates to a 22% YoY growth rate 148 (40% ENT FSI and 10% Fintech), which is significantly better than the Nov Forecasts, but still carries risk in Fintech Forecast, 149 especially. We are identifying a PTG for the remaining gap over the next few weeks. In summary, we continue to expect growth in 150 the Banking and Capital Markets verticals. Insurance will be muted but will grow at a moderate pace. There is limited baseline 151 erosion in Enterprise FSI accounts (E.g. NSE $2.55M, RBL $1.57M) but there are headwinds in Fintech. In Fintech, Quadeye (Entered 152 new markets, and crypto) and Paytm (consolidation from other regions to India) had one-time events in 2023 that will not recur in 153 FY24. We expect our big bets to start paying dividends in FY25 and beyond and are confident of reaching $1B in 5Y. 154 Revenue Concentration: Top 19% (32 out of 171) of 155 the accounts, when viewed at a parent level, drive 80% 156 of FSI Revenue. At the child level, this translates to Top 157 17% of the 264 accounts driving 80% of the revenue. 158 However, the long tail of FSI is growing at a much faster 159 rate than the top accounts, which should help reduce concentration. 160 3.1 Sales motion implementation and verticalization 161 Sales Motions: The FSI Deep (ENT) segment ($66M YTD Nov’23), comprises 13 Banks (~$1B TAS, 7 PSU, 6 Private Sector Banks) 162 including subsidiaries and 1 large NBFC group (Bajaj Finserv) and will be addressed with 14 AMs (12 BIS, 1 open HC, 1 to be raised), 163 and 14 SAs. To drive optimal coverage, accounts >500K ARR will have 1:1 AM to account coverage ratio, with 5 Greenfield PSU Banks 164 at 1:2.5 coverage ratio. The key pillars of our GTM will include: 1/ Influence the cultural transformation of the largest FSIs in India: 165 To become the innovation partner of their choice by positively influencing their culture, we will invest in long term executive 166 relationships with CXOs (aligning exec sponsors from AWS), leverage CXO engagement mechanisms such as COI/WB to help them 167

Amazon Confidential  Page 4 of 12 accelerate their pace of innovation (making it real with Prototyping and Hackathons), Envisioning workshops/LFA/EBCs to better 168 unpack their transformation agendas to align better to their goals, and leverage BCAP/GSI Partners to build credible transformation 169 proposals for these large FS behemoths. 2/ Migration & modernization focus of ISV workloads (E.g.: Lentra/Mindgate at HDFC 170 Bank, Finacle Lite at Axis Bank etc) will continue to drive in-year revenue with FSI IGA helping us unlock better GTM and cloud-171 native stack readiness of these ISVs. Our investment in CSMs coupled with ES will help us accelerate execution 3/ CX and Digital 172 Banking: To harness a key trend of these large Banks investing in in-house builders to esp. build CX & digital platforms, our focus 173 on T&C, Account Based Marketing & enablement (to be detailed in an account plan) will help us build skills and nurture AWS 174 champions across the breadth of their organization. 4/ Public Sector Banks: Within the PSU Bank space, we have begun to make 175 headway with the creation of a dedicated landing zone at State Bank of India (India’s largest Bank), CRMNext win(5Y/$3M) at Punjab 176 National Bank(3rd largest PSU) and Cloud transformation VMCA win at Union Bank of India($600K ARR). For 2024, unlocking PSBs 177 is a big bet, the plan for which is elaborated in our Think Big plan. 178 FSI Focus (ENT) consists of 118 accounts (child a/cs) spread across 9 territories (with 1 dedicated GRN territory with ~24 accounts) 179 with $59M TTM revenue, spread across sub-industries as 44 banking (or lending/NBFCs), 21 capital market cos, 18 insurers and rest 180 as other misc. financial services providers. The average coverage ratio in engaged territories is 1:11 in ENG and 1:24 in GRN. The 181 territories are regionally spread as Mumbai (5), Chennai (1), BLR (1) and Delhi (1) with an optimal mix of Focus core and select 182 accounts. One territory in Mumbai is predominantly focused on Capital Markets, while the rest are a mixed across sub verticals. FSI 183 Focus sales motion will help customer drive their transformation goals by 1/ Driving industry specific solutions, esp. with LOB 184 stakeholders across Digital banking, lending solutions, CX, risk management, underwriting, claims, analytics, etc. These solutions 185 will be tailored with partners (SIs/GSIs) or vertical ISVs driving a co-sell motion or migrating/upgrading solutions from on-prem to 186 cloud. 2/ Migrations and modernization will continue to be a focus to win new tactical workloads or establish a long-term cloud 187 roadmap to eventually drive DC exit opportunities; 3/ Partners: Align with specific partners (SI/GSIs –atleast 2 per customer) 188 captured in a territory plan (to be completed before Mar 1st) and driven by PSMs for proactive interlock and cadence. 4/ Marketing 189 & Innovation Programs: Leverage FS industry specific marketing programs (3rd party Industry events, ExecLeaders, FS Symposium 190 & roundtables) to drive net new contact acquisition or nurture exec relationships. To better align with cultural transformation 191 agenda of our customers, DI (both 1:1 & IXA format) will be key to help us become the preferred Innovation partner. (Appendix 7).  192 FSI Fintech business consists of 4 Deep accounts (3 from Payment and 1 from Capital Markets, with $119M TAS and $94.6M TTM 193 revenue) and the Focus cohort consists of 51 accounts (37 in Payments, 5 in Crypto, 4 Capital Markets & 5 Insurers) spread across 194 6 territories with $355M TAS and $99M TTM revenue in 2023, to be covered by 6 AMs and 5 SAs across 6 territories. 2024 Focus: 195 1/ Increase our Share of Wallet (SOW): With increased competitive activity in the last 18 months, we will continue to focus on 196 increasing our 79% share in our top 20 fintech accounts, which contribute to 86% of Fintech revenue. This year, we will target to 197 have a PPA with all Top 20 customers. We currently have 19 but 6 of them are up for renewal in 2024. (Details in Appendix 8). 2/ 198 Strengthen Executive connects: We will continue our focus to build deeper connects with our top 20 customers esp. with 199 Founder/CEO/CTO relationships through 1:1 Executive connects, AWS marketing forums for builders (Mumbai Summit, ReInvent, 200 AI Conclave etc.) and leveraging existing Marketing programs such as  the FSI Symposium. We will also leverage One Amazon 201 initiatives to drive Pan-Amazon synergies, e.g.: A.in relationships with PayU for Payment processing and Razorpay for Digital Suite 202 offerings. 3/ Operational excellence: We will complete Value maps and Account plans for top 20 customers by 15th Feb with 203 operational cadences to drive execution of the plans. Cost Optimisation will be a priority for our top customers with a goal to 204 improve the COI score from avg. of 63 to 73 by end of FY24, also increase the Graviton adoption from 8.9% to 13%. 4/ Focus on 205 next set of High Growth Accounts: We will identify the “Next 15” (from Focus) accounts & target opportunities in whitespaces. E.g. 206 Analytics/AIML opportunities in 5 of our 20 accounts that are not using AWS native services. 5 Migration prospects (PhonePe, 207 BillDesk, Paisabazaar, Wimbo, CCAvenue) and drive $3M in 2024.  208 Partner Motion: Partner attach in ENT FSI (excluding Fintechs) has grown to 75% in 2023 (vs. 70.1% in 2022). We aim to take this 209 further to 80%+ in 2024. Fintechs, who are largely builders had a partner attach of 33.2% (vs. 28% in 2022). In 2024 our partner 210 strategy will revolve around the following 4 key pillars in FSI: 1/ Proactively Partnering with GSIs to drive transformational 211 outcomes: Our engagement with GSIs has grown significantly (over 70% YoY) in 2023 for 3 out of top 5 GSIs. Overall GSI pipeline 212 grew over 137% YoY to $21.89M, reflecting both GSI interest, AWS Sellers engaging partners pro-actively and the preference from 213 customers in transformational opportunities. Some large transformational projects with GSIs in 2023 included HDFC Bank (Deloitte 214 cloud consulting), Bajaj Finserv Group (TCS), Equitas Bank (IBM, digital banking build). PSMs will own and drive Partner plans with 215 proactive interlock with key GSIs (at least 1 incumbent and 1 challenger GSI in every ENT deep and 20% of ENT Focus accounts by 216 end Q1; drive interlock with at least 1 BCAP per Deep account in H1). 2/ SI Partners for migrations & modernization: Key SI and 217 regional consulting Partners provide us scale and execution capabilities for migration & modernization with many also bringing in 218 FSI expertise on applications, process knowhow or security/regulatory compliance capabilities. We will identify 7 priority SI partners 219 (WIP: CXIO, Rackspace, ACC, Lumiq, Quadra, Ganit, Oneture) with who we will drive maximum proactive sales interlocks as well as 220 maximise 1:1 FS LT connect + cadence to build traction for better coverage. 3/ FSI ISV Partners: FSI ISV partners continue to be the 221 backbone of ENT FSIs in India, this motion elaborated in the FSI IGA section. We will also be working closely with 1/2 partners (like 222 TCS) on our Think Big opportunity to enable a DC Exit at large banks, which will require a multi-year transformational approach. 223 JAN 2024 | FY23 OP2 – FSI 
Amazon Confidential  Page 5 of 12 3.2 FSI Industry Solutions IGA Update:  224 FSI Industry solutions IGA objectives: 1/ Identify, Cultivate and Enable FSI ISVs to build cloud enabled Industry Solutions on AWS, 225 and 2/ Joint GTM of these Industry Solutions to drive value to ISV and FSI customers. 226 2023 performance vs. plan: Attainment in 2023 of $1.3M (60%). Gap in attainment due to: 1/ HDFC-CRMNext ($3M ARR) moving 227 to 2024, 2/ HDFC-Mindgate deferment ($1.7M ARR), 3/ ICICI Bank-Intellect Design moving to 2024 ($600K ARR), 4/ PNB-CRMNext 228 moving to 2024 ($600K ARR). These will provide a fast start for 2024. Another learning is the time required to align an ISV. It takes 229 3-5 months and FSI sales cycle is longer (4-6 months). Ramp time for revenue is longer than anticipated. IGA has strengthened our 230 Industry Solutions messaging to customers by bringing the entire gamut of FSI relevant partner products mapped to FSI application 231 landscape. During 2023, IGA team identified 90 ISVs, targeted 55 and connected 45 ISVs across 25+ areas (Appendix 9). Enabled 232 field teams with 14 Path’shala’ sessions, 50+ SA sessions and Joint GTM. This translated into 137 opportunities created across 67 233 unique FSI customers and 56 opportunities launched with ARR value of $4M. Key launched opportunities include CRMNext-Axis 234 Bank, Mindgate-Yes Bank, Pennant-Piramal Finance, Pennant-Avanse Finance, Decimal-AU SFB and Intellect-IDFC First. 235 2024 goals and execution plan: With Dec’23 exit MRR at $297K, we will reach an aggregate $4.9M from beginning till ’24 end. Will 236 need incremental $3.2M to meet the overall 3Y IGA target. Execution Plan to meet this: 1/ Pipeline of $7.4M in place with $1.7M in 237 Bus Val + Tech Val + Committed stage, 2/ We will execute a fast start program to accelerate closure of the opportunities in pipeline: 238 HDFC-CRMNext (first year ARR of $800K), HDFC-Mindgate (ARR $1.7M), Axis Bank-TSYS (ARR $960K), IDFC-Montran ($400K), 3/ We 239 now observe a pattern of deal replication which will support non-linear growth during 2024 e.g. CRMNext (HDFC, Axis, SBI, Canara, 240 PNB, Muthoot, JK Bank), Pennant (Piramal, Avanse, HDFC, Axis Finance, UNO Bank, Unity SFB, Ecofy, Vistaar), Mindgate (HDFC, Yes 241 Bank, IndusInd, RBL, Kotak), Liquitics (Kotak, ICICI, IndusInd, Unity SFB, Bandhan), 4/ In 2024, we will be running with 1.5 HC (1 AM 242 and 1 SA distributed between IGA and FSI accounts). Beyond revenue, IGA has a long-term impact by 1/ gaining mindshare with 243 ISVs to recommend AWS e.g. Mindgate (aligned to Azure earlier) is now AWS-First; CRMNext quoted 4 RFPs with AWS in 2023; 244 Pennant is recommending AWS as preferred partner 2/ identifying niche AWS-ready FSI industry solutions which were out of 245 purview earlier e.g. Liquitics, Coherent Global, VirSoftech, Veefin etc. 3/ entering into industry solution conversation with FSI 246 customers. Our mission is to make this the best FSI sales team in the industry, highly competent in solution-selling to our customers. 247 3.3 Q1’24 Fast Start  248 FSI in 2024, combines ENT FSI and Fintech, will focus on: 1/Account transition plan: New account team introductions and knowledge 249 transfers to be concluded by Jan 31st. 2/ Exec Connect: In order to drive deeper strategic ties and stronger account relationship we 250 will have a connect between Segment leader/ FLM and senior stakeholders of our top 30 accounts (that drive 70% of the revenue) 251 by Q1 and reach top 45 accounts that drive 80% of the revenue by end of H1. 3/ Focus on GenAI : We will explore (5th Feb- 1st Mar) 252 and execute GenAI opportunities in our Top 25 accounts with the support of our SA team with a target to pursue 15 Qualified+ 253 Opps. 4/ Team enablement: To benefit from Industry alignment model we need to train/upskill our team with relevant industry 254 knowledge/ available sales plays. We will work with Field Enablement team and Industry BD/Specialist team to roll out training 255 calendar and enablement for the year. 5/ Partner led Sales play: a/Co sell motion: Drive programmatic (19th Feb -29th Mar) co-sell 256 by focusing on five domains (Storage, Security, Analytics). b/ SRRP Prospecting campaign with 4 identified SRRP partners (PaloAlto, 257 Zscaler, MongoDb, Trendmicro) to build a SRRP pipeline in Q1’24 ($2M creation). 6/ Industry Specific Sales Plays with ISV solutions 258 (CRMNext, Penant, Mindgate) to provide solution-based offering to our customers with a target to create $5 M pipe. 259 4.0 Think Big plan: Build an integrated $1B FSI business (5X growth) by driving deeper penetration  260 Incremental revenue potential of $250M-$300M over 3Y. With rapid digitization of key infrastructure like payments and faster 261 adoption of digital channels like eBanking and Mobile, Banks have had to innovate at a faster pace than ever before to deliver 262 differentiated customer experiences and build higher resiliency on core systems. This has led Banks to embrace technology as a 263 core tenet to drive business outcomes. This has given an opportunity to explore bold DC Exit opportunities at some large banks to 264 drive deeper penetration in FSI ($200M+ ARR, $2.6B TAS across segments). FSI can be an engine of growth for India. While we will 265 continue to engage early to build cloud native solutions with Fintechs, the GTM plan for ENT FSI customers will involve a 4-pronged 266 approach focused on the highest TAS opportunities to build a $1B FSI business. 1/ Data Center (DC) exit program: Currently, only 267 about 10% of core banking/insurance workloads are on the cloud, and targeted DC exits are crucial to increase adoption. We will 268 focus on the top 16 FSI customers across banking (e.g. HDFC, ICICI, SBI, Axis, Yes Bank) & insurance (e.g. Max Life, BAGIC/BALIC, 269 ICICI Prudential Life), and target to win 60% of TAS/$100M+ ARR each, over the next 3Y-5Y (regulatory guidelines mandate a multi-270 cloud approach, thereby limiting penetration). This approach will require sustained CEO level executive engagements, tight 271 #OneAWS execution, & customized incentive programs to build early traction. We will also need to invest in a Business Development 272 team that has experience driving such large-scale DC Exits, including crafting the ideal commercial construct. 2/ Partner with leading 273 ISVs & GSIs to modernize & deploy FSI SaaS solutions: Currently, almost all traditional ENT FSIs leverage core banking applications 274 from GSIs/ISVs (e.g. TCS BaNCS, Infosys/ Finacle, Oracle FlexCube, GroupAsia & LifeAsia from DXC), but these solutions are 275 predominantly on-prem and are heavily dependent on an Oracle stack. This presents an opportunity to migrate & modernize these 276 applications (with support from our WW service teams), while engaging with the FSIs to deploy them, and will require a cohesive, 277 tripartite GTM approach between the ISV/GSIs, the banks and AWS. 3/ Continue engaging with regulators and strengthen AWS’ 278 role in “Make in India”. In addition to focused regulatory engagement to ensure cloud adoption by FSIs is viewed favourably by the 279 JAN 2024 | FY23 OP2 – FSI 
Amazon Confidential  Page 6 of 12 regulators, we need to build evidence for AWS’ role in the “Make in India” narrative beyond having local data centers (e.g., MSFT-280 Jio, OCI-Airtel), given the focus on self-reliance and an India Cloud. The Indian government is actively considering its options for a 281 “sovereign cloud”, to have more strategic control over cloud providers providing infrastructure to public sector and regulated 282 industries. Partnering with a reputed conglomerate like TATA Sons to build such an “India Cloud” offering will be crucial to ensure 283 AWS continues to be a player in the Indian FS industry. [Ask]:1/  Investment in a senior project management headcount to build 284 and manage an execution plan, including driving partner conversations, in collaboration with the PSM and GSI teams.2/ AWS WW 285 and APJ leadership commitment to drive regular (twice a year, once the project is conceptualized) interactions with CEOs of at least 286 4 banks (SBI, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank). A T2T2T (that includes partner CEO connect) will be crucial to accelerate such a 287 bold initiative in India, where cloud adoption in Banking is still very nascent.3/ A strategic partnership with a conglomerate like 288 TATA sons, to drive India Cloud offerings. 4/ Drive momentum in Public Sector Banks ($700M TAS): India has 10 Public sector Banks 289 (PSB) who contribute to 48% of the Retail-MSME credit market in India. Out of these, 6 PSBs will covered as Deep accounts (2 290 engaged – SBI, Canara; and 4 GF – BOB, PNB, BOI, UBI). The PSBs are publicly listed for-profit commercial organizations, but with 291 government shareholding, have unique organization structures (most top execs have a lifetime tenure at PSBs), complex & 292 consensus driven decision-making processes (via strictly defined RFP processes) and have traditionally been slow to adopt any new 293 technology compared to Private sector Banks in India (we est. a 18-24 months lag in tech adoption). However, with Private Banks 294 on a firm journey to public cloud adoption with material workloads, we have seen early signs of interest from PSBs to get started. 295 We will drive momentum in this sector to deliver ~4M in 2024 and $60M over 5 years. A detailed write-up on PSB is in Appendix 6. 296 5.0 Summary of key risks, dependencies and asks (beyond the asks for Big Bets): 297 1/ Constant Currency offerings for 5 years. As evidenced in the conversations with CAMS, HDFC Life (and it is expected to be an ask 298 by Public Sector Banks, as we make inroads), a 5-year INR pricing commercial construct is increasingly becoming critical to win in 299 India. 2/ In order to drive more revenue, expedite availability of MP and other strategic services (like Gen AI) in India. 3/ Competitive 300 ProServe pricing (as compared to other CSPs and large GSIs) will become a key requirement to move business critical workloads to 301 AWS at large FSIs. Indian FSIs, who are yet to become proficient builders, frequently require OEM skin in the game for mission 302 critical projects. Anecdotal feedback suggests we can be up to 2x competition currently, which is not scalable. This will also be 303 critical to win more standalone ProServe opportunities vs relying too heavily on PPA Attach. ProServe should also have the same 304 funding levers that are available for partners, to ensure parity 4/ Marketing: (a) Adequate funding for in-account initiatives for Deep 305 and some Focus-Select accounts.(b) An in-person FSI Forum for the top 25-30 FSI (across Enterprise and Fintech) stakeholders, to 306 enable networking, share learnings, deepen CXO connects and showcase our large transformation successes. 5/ Incremental 307 headcount: (a)  Specialist BD/SA pod for Gen AI and 1 Specialist BD/SA pod for Data/ Analytics, dedicated to FSI.(b) Incremental SA 308 coverage of 8 SAs (3 for Deep, 3 for Fintech, 1 for Focus and 1 for FSI ISV) to ensure adequate coverage (c) Dedicated program 309 manager to support FSI initiatives. 6/ Increased CSM coverage for all MAP 2.0 across Deep and Focus; CSM for every Deep account 310 billing more than $5M ARR. 7/ SSOE support to operationalize revenue sharing across FSI and ISV/SUP teams to drive better 311 collaboration between the teams. 8/ A specific comp for Public sector Banks in Deep Sales motion. These banks will take 2-3 years 312 to ramp-up owing to the slow bureaucratic processes in these organizations. Requesting a 2-3 year sales plan for AMs covering 313 Banks like SBI, Canara Bank, that are no longer in Greenfield as group entities are billing with AWS. Greenfield tag is assessed at the 314 parent level, leading to these 0 biller banks to not be eligible for a Greenfield compensation plan. 9/ TAS data used for segmentation 315 has data errors (e.g. IndusInd Bank, the 5th largest private sector bank, is shown with $11M TAS, while its microfinance subsidiary, 316 Bharat Financial, is show to have $29M TAS). Inaccuracies in TAS data has led to 2 large accounts moving to Scale (e.g. Indian 317 Overseas Bank, Indian Bank are among the top 10 Public sector banks in the country). Request for a window to correct these errors 318 for some obvious accounts. 319 6.0 Conclusion: 320 2023 was a challenging year for FSI. There have been multiple headwinds like intense focus on CO (over 50% of customers), loss of 321 a large account like Dhani (introduced a gap of $3.2M), Zscaler claw back of $3.8M (Full year) and some significant disruptive events 322 in the Fintech segment (covered earlier in the doc). However, there are significant tailwinds and FSI continues to be in a position to 323 drive good growth, if some big bets materialize and some of the regulatory and policy uncertainties are solved for. We also expect 324 a resurgence of the Fintech sector in 18-24 months time, when more investments are likely to come into this sector. We strongly 325 believe we will continue to outpace the India growth rate in this segment, and can move the integrated Enterprise and Fintech 326 vertical to a 30%+ growth in the next 24 months. The team enjoys high Earn Trust with customer stakeholders across all sub-327 verticals. We will continue to be intentional about retaining that trust. Senior stakeholders from 2 large banks remarked that they 328 have never seen any other technology vendor provide such support.  329 7.0 Frequently Asked Questions 330 7.1 What “dogs not barking” worry you?  331 1/ Ambiguity around Regulatory/ Policy direction around India Cloud and the ability to host business critical workloads on US HQed 332 CSPs (NSE who have scaled down their cloud footprint). Currently, UIDAI is not approving the use of cloud for Aadhar Vault and 333 AUA/KUA services. 2/ A push by regulators to explore cloud ready and CSP agnostic solutions, potentially slowing the down the 334 JAN 2024 | FY23 OP2 – FSI 
Amazon Confidential  Page 7 of 12 adoption of our cloud native services, the core of our modernization strategy. We continue to work closely with the PP team on 335 both topics. We will need a concerted effort, in collaboration with PS teams, to address the same.  336 7.2 How are competitors innovating in your area?  337 Competitors are relying on aggressive discounts to win targeted workloads (E.g. GCP at HDFC Ergo) rather than Innovation, with the 338 exception of the OpenAI partnership of MS. Early availability of Gen AI offerings in India (E.g. Vertex AI and Open AI) have provided 339 them a head start with FSI customers, with early whitelisting. We need Bedrock availability in India in early Q1’24. We will leverage 340 the GenAI Innovation Center as a strategic tool to drive business outcomes at large customers. 341 7.3 Which industry vertical initiatives are critical for growth acceleration? What support do you need from BDSI specialists?  342 Growth in Banking, and Retention in Fintech will be key factors to drive growth in FSI. We’ll need BDSI expertise to drive 343 transformational DC exit programs. Continued support of BDSI specialists in Deep and Focus Select will be needed to drive 344 conversations with LoB leaders. BDSI support will also be needed to establish AWS as a thought leader in driving business outcomes 345 in FSI through Industry events and supporting regional and WW CxO initiatives. This is required to bring global learnings to India as 346 well as offer a platform for Indian leaders to showcase their success globally. 347 Appendices 348 Appendix 1: Overview of FSI segment split 349

Amazon Confidential  Page 9 of 12 - Database ($24.7M ARR 2023 YTD, 10% YoY), Containers ($17.5M ARR 2023 YTD, 14% YoY), Analytics ($8.67M ARR 2023 YTD, -4% 362 YoY), AI/ML ($0.61M ARR 2023 YTD, 24% YoY). Key thematic areas of our wins and losses are: a) Containers:  We are able to influence 363 our customers to adopt containers (running on Graviton chips and spot instances) as infrastructure choice to optimize costs and 364 improve utilization. E.g. Upstox migrated their order management platform on EKS with Karpenter ($0.3M YTD Nov, 74% YoY), PayU 365 launched Thought Machine - a Core Banking application on EKS ($0.42M YTD Nov, 61% YoY), CoinDCX launched their DeFi/CeFI on 366 EKS  with Karpenter ($0.6M YTD Nov, 682% YoY), Paytm migrated and re-architected their Auth application from Ali-cloud to EKS 367 ($0.8M YTD Nov, 55% YoY), Polygon re-architected their monolith applications running on EC2 to ECS utilizing Fargate ($0.63M YTD 368 Nov, 2796% YoY). b) Databases: For relational use-cases such as transactional consistency, better performance and scalability, un-369 differentiated heavy lifting of database management and DR capabilities (with Aurora), customers such as Paytm, PayU, BharatPe, 370 Upstox, Razorpay continue to scale on RDS (especially RDS Aurora), thus driving the usage. For NoSQL use-cases, ‘Key-Value pair’ 371 requirement is the most sought after and is extensively used in use-cases such as data-store for micro-services, other applications 372 which can work with eventual consistency model. For such use-cases, Dynamo DB is preferred by customers such as Paytm (Ads 373 team), PayU, CoinDCX due to its performance and serverless architecture. Besides Dynamo DB, we’re also seeing interest from 374 Fintech customers such as Polygon technology, PayU, Navi Technology, Paytm for storing JSON data as documents, thus driving up 375 the utilization of Document DB. c) Analytics: Customers such as Navi Technologies, Paytm, PayU, Slice, Polygon have continued to 376 build and scale their data pipelines using Lakehouse architecture which has driven the usage of Amazon Managed Streaming for 377 Kafka ($1.3M YTD Nov, 36% YoY), EMR ($2.2M YTD Nov, 55% YoY) and Athena ($0.55M YTD Nov, 1% YoY). Slice, a fintech major in 378 Lending business have migrated from Databricks to EMR (#winback from compete ISVs, contributing to EMR ) as EMR is able to 379 offer a better price to performance and more choices of run-times (such as Flink, Trino). Customers undertook various optimization 380 activities on their OpenSearch clusters e.g. archival/periodic maintenance of data, graviton adoption, node re-sizing which led to 381 reduction of OpenSearch usage (and hence 18% YoY drop in revenue). Redshift usage also contracted ($1.17M YTD Nov, -36% YoY) 382 as customers moved to Lakehouse architecture 383 Appendix 5: Gen AI update: 384 Across traditional FSI enterprises, 34 GenAI sessions across 23 FSI customers were conducted. These sessions were attended by 385 600+ attendees and received an avg CSAT of 4.5/5. Apart from customer sessions, 2 enablement sessions conducted for field teams 386 covering the basics of Gen AI, AWS services positioning, demos, industry use cases and partners to engage. These sessions led to 387 discussion of 22 customer uses cases across various customers across 11 FSI customers, among which 5 POCs are currently in 388 progress. Based on the POC discussions 22 customer influences for Amazon Bedrock availability in BOM region were created 389 influencing $517K. SA team has 3 GenAI ambassadors and co-owned the AWS Generative AI Hackathon Playbook . This document 390 helped the SA team conduct 14 Workshops / Hackathons (including Axis Bank) across multiple customers across India and attended 391 by 1200+ participants. Details can be found in https://quip-amazon.com/ZgCoAatZU0yb/AWS-Generative-AI-Hackathon-Playbook-392 for-ENT. There has been executive engagement with service teams at Axis Bank (Bedrock, Kendra & Plato), HDFC Bank (Gen AI 393 focussed EBC), BFL (Gen AI focussed EBC). This has led to PoCs at all these customers, Axis Bank PoC is in progress & at other 394 customers in discussion.  395 Enterprise Wins - From customer adoption of AWS GenAI services, GaadiBazaar (NLP powered query) is in CUG, MaxLife 396 (conversational bot for agents) has been rolled out to be used by 1000 support agents (Winner in AI Conclave) and ICICI Lombard 397 has deployed 2 uses case (Chatbots) in Pre-prod.  Additionally, we have got one of our Focus customers - Fincare Small Finance 398 Bank experimenting with Claude and Titan and will go live in Q1 24 ($100k) 399 Across Fintech : Across 4 deep accounts (Paytm, Quadeye Securities, Razorpay, Cred) - we’ve done 10+ sessions with these 400 customers covering technical topics such as Sagemaker Jumpstart, CodeWhisperer, Bedrock, recently launched services Amazon Q, 401 QuickSight Q (done at Paytm only) resulting in a) Paytm evaluating Sagemaker Jumpstart, Bedrock for use-cases such as 402 Personalised QR generation, document Q&A to improve the productivity of operations team and            Code Whisperer b) Razorpay 403 has successfully completed a PoC of Amazon Bedrock (using Claude V2) to build a merchant assistance bot which will replace a 404 similar bot built with OpenAI. Razorpay is moving out of OpenAI due to better pricing of ClaudeV2 when compared to OpenAI. 405 Razorpay is also evaluating Amazon              Bedrock (Claude) vs OpenAI to create an automated data-dictionary for Data-406 warehousing tables. c) Happay, part of Cred, is evaluating Amazon Bedrock (Claude V2) to build an expense management 407 application. We’ve partnered with WWSO team to drive these GenAI engagements which included activities such as - customer 408 leadership engagement to create mindshare on AWS services, in-account developer engagement thru GenAI hackathons 409 (conducted in 1 each at Paytm and Razorpay), customer enablement, support in technical evaluation of AWS GenAI services and 410 engagement with WW GenAI team. Thru our activities in these accounts, we’ve been able to secure the sponsorship of key customer 411 stakeholders such as CTO, Head of Data Science.  412 Fintech Wins: Our activities in 2023 has resulted in 2 GenAI launches at Paytm. a) Launch of personalised QR code in Paytm app 413 using Stable Diffusion to celebrate Indian Independence Day (ARR $60K) b) Rent agreement analysis using Textract, Sagemaker 414 Jumpstart (Cohere Generate Model - Command) for text summarization, Q&A (ARR $66K).  415 JAN 2024 | FY23 OP2 – FSI 
Amazon Confidential  Page 10 of 12 Challenges/Learnings: a) To comply with data residency requirements, fintech customers are seeking Bedrock availability in BOM 416 region. Additionally, for Bedrock BOM region launch we would need feature parity with N. Virginia region viz. Agents, Knowledge 417 Base as customers like Paytm are seeking these features (PFR link from Paytm account)  b) Prompt engineering in Bedrock is 418 verbose when compared with OpenAI e.g. in situations wherein calculations need to be done, OpenAI can invoke external agents 419 seamlessly without end users doing prompt engineering (such as agents and tools). Customer developers have also mentioned to 420 us that with OpenAI, there is a plethora of tutorials/online guides available. Claude has limited amount of prompt engineering 421 (and other help guides) available and at times this has become a blocker during evaluation stages c) For certain use-cases, we’ve 422 found that OpenAI is able to provide better prediction accuracy when compared with Bedrock e.g. at Razorpay for multi-lingual 423 Auto-eKYC use-case, OpenAI was found to provide a better prediction accuracy when compared to Claude on Amazon Bedrock d) 424 We’ve not been successful in helping our customer adopt Code Whisperer in compete against Github Co-pilot. Feedbacks 425 received – 1/ The number of English words needed by CodeWhisperer to  generate working code sample is verbose when 426 compared to Github Co-pilot  2/ Code Whisperer had been un-able to scan existing code repositories thereby   limiting the 427 developers’ ability to use in daily situations. In FY24, we will re-engage our customers on Code Whisperer basis of the reinvent 428 launches. 429 Appendix 6: Think Big for Public Sector Banks: 430 Plan for 2024: India has 10 Public sector Banks (PSB) who contribute to 48% of the Retail-MSME credit market in India. Out of these, 431 6 PSBs will covered as Deep accounts (2 engaged – SBI, Canara; and 4 GF – BOB, PNB, BOI, UBI), with a combined estimated TAS of 432 ~$900M. The PSBs are publicly listed for-profit commercial organizations, but with government shareholding, have unique 433 organization structures (most top execs have a lifetime tenure at PSBs), complex & consensus driven decision-making processes 434 (via strictly defined RFP processes) and have traditionally been slow to adopt any new technology compared to Private sector Banks 435 in India (we est. a 18-24 months lag in tech adoption). However, with Private Banks on a firm journey to public cloud adoption with 436 material workloads, we have seen early signs of interest from PSBs to get started. Some key beachheads, we currently have in PSBs 437 include Co-lending platform at SBI (Yubi), Canara (SFDC SRRP win via RFP), PNB (CRMNext win, $3M/5Y), UBI (VMCA for T&D, $650K 438 ARR committed stage), Central Bank Housing Finance ($200K ARR), SBI GIC ($3.6M/3Y PPA), Canara HSBC ($200K ARR), etc. To put 439 them on a firm path to AWS cloud, we will drive the following key initiatives in 2024: 1/ Building a security & compliance foundation: 440 In 2024, we will focus on building a strong security & compliance foundation helping build awareness across security and other 441 teams, and help them better understand the operational controls needed on AWS to meet their regulatory needs. This should 442 culminate in building a landing zone across these Banks. Landing zone plans have already been kickstarted at SBI with discussions 443 in progress at PNB and UBI; 2/ Building executive sponsorship for Cloud adoption: by engaging CIOs and Executive Directors (EDs 444 are function heads who report into MDs) to build mindshare drive specific call-to-actions of identifying the first set of workloads to 445 be migrated 3/ Joint account planning with key ISVs: Work on joint account planning with key strategic ISVs such as CRMNext, SFDC, 446 Nucleus, Lentra, Newgen, Finacle, Mindgate, TCS Bancs, Workapps, etc. E.g.: This has helped us identify opportunities in SBI, PNB, 447 Canara, etc. with two key wins (with CRMNext at PNB, $3M/5yr; and SFDC at Canara Bank) 4/ Align with incumbent and challenger 448 GSIs/Large SI partners (atleast 2 per account): All PSBs have major GSIs as their outsourcing partners. PSBs typically award end-to-449 end RFPs for specific applications/initiatives on a turnkey basis for 5/ 7 years including implementation and managed services to an 450 SI/GSIs. Early alignment will help us engage/identify early Pre-RFP stage opportunities. 6/ Skilling and enablement: Given their low 451 Cloud awareness levels, we will work to drive both broad based and executive skilling and enablement initiatives across these 452 accounts including leveraging marketing (ABM). 7/ Focus on Banking Subsidiaries for In-year growth: PSBs have Insurance, cards, 453 securities, NBFC or wealth mgmt. subsidiaries who generally have more autonomy in decision making (relative to the Parent Bank) 454 due to their governance structure and smaller size. Some subsidiaries such as Canara HSBC, SBI GIC, etc. have already started on 455 Cloud/AWS with key applications, giving us an opportunity to accelerate them in 2024. Tactically, the above key initiatives will be 456 captured in an account plan collaborating with extended teams to drive our alignment and focus. We will also engage external 457 influencers and bodies such as IBA (Indian Banking Association, which is dominated by PSB members) to drive thought leadership 458 (E.g.: participating in industry events such as IBA Awards & pursue joint publishing of whitepapers) or one-to-many 459 initiatives/workshops on Cloud transformation. The key sales plays will include: a/ ISV aligned sales play; b/ Data platforms, 460 regulatory reporting & ML; c/ Security and threat intelligence solutions to engage CISO offices; d/ VMCA, as a point of entry for 461 T&D, peripheral workloads (replicate the win with UBI, $650K ARR) e/ Digital Banking (a big investment area for PSBs as they try to 462 raise their digital customer experiences to become on-par with Private Banks); f/ Co-lending and Agri lending solutions play: PSBs 463 have a lion’s share of Agri & ‘priority sector’ lending market India. We believe, our increased investments into PSBs from 2024 464 coupled with the specific strategies listed about should set us on path to unlock their potential and drive accelerated growth to 10X 465 to an est. ~27.5M ARR by FY27 (from <$2.3M in2023). 466 JAN 2024 | FY23 OP2 – FSI

For the Focus cohort of accounts, 474 marketing will focus on mapping industry and LoB use cases, identify 1P + 3P solutions to address them, and curate localized GTM 475 activities. Our effort is to prioritize FSI deep accounts and high value Fintech/ Enterprise Focus accounts by a) Driving a retention 476 play with Top 20 customers (69% of segment revenue) with curated interventions like ABM in account events, FSI dedicated track 477 in Summit, FSI only ExecLeaders, bigger participation in the Fintech forum, higher representation at re:Invent and EBC roaster. b) 478 Building growth plays for Next 43 accounts (Focus Select, 19% of FSI revenue) through India properties like FSI Conclave (25+ CXOs 479 and 250+ITDM audience), Customer events like Razorpay FTX, industry association/Analyst events (Gartner/IBA/ IDC), CxO Forum 480 engagements in partnership with ISV (Lentra) and community led engagements like FSI Tech Leaders Assembly (ITDMs focused). c) 481 Driving Scale Enablement Motions for Focus core will happen primarily via digital properties i.e. APJ led digital programs like 482 innovate, webinars, virtual account workshops and selective 3rd party industry events like IDG100, ET BFSI forum, CNBC Gen AI 483 forum. We will also accelerate our efforts on building brand plays with leading publishers especially for FSI. We have to scale our 484 FSI References by >2X. While we have had 10+ referenceable assets created in the last 12 months (HDFC Life/Axis Bank), we need 485 to double down on case studies as FSI customers take longer to approve case studies/ PTI articles. We did 5 written FSI case studies 486 in last 12 months (Freecharge, Paytm, Setu)  and have  additional 3 case studies in progress( SBI Life, Max Life & HDFC) 487 Appendix 8: Cross-service PPA in Fintech 488 Account Name Term Length Deal Expiration Date  TCV Paytm Mobile Solutions Pvt.

Amazon Confidential  Page 1 of 12 The purpose of this document is to give the reader an overview of the Financial Services business in India, some context around the 1 India nuances, key macro factors that are driving behaviour around cloud adoption, plans for FY24 and our big bets. 2 Vision: FSI vision is to be the ‘Transformation Partner’ of choice for the FSI Industry and a catalyst for cultural transformation and 3 Innovation. We want to be the largest CSP (primary/ preferred cloud provider) for the top 10 customers in Banking, Insurance, 4 Capital Markets and NBFC. Currently, we are meaningfully engaged at 7/10 Private sector banks (largest CSP at 4), top 9 insurers 5 (both life and non-life insurance companies, largest at 7) and 14 of 16 non-banking financial companies. We plan to enable Fintechs 6 to become the preferred rails for "Digital Public Infrastructure", while increasing our wallet share further to 85%+, from the current 7 79%. In the next 5 years, we aspire to build this into a $1B business. 8 1.0 Business Overview: 9 1.1 Historical trends, TAS, view of Greenfield, Net new vs. Recurring: 10 Financial Services segment covers ~$3B in TAS. Banking sub-segment is 11 by-far the largest with low penetration, which gives a significant 12 runway for growth, with the right regulatory conditions. 11% of these 13 accounts are Greenfield, representing 20% of the TAS. A big percentage 14 of this is in Public Sector Banks. The adjacent table gives a breakdown 15 of accounts covered in each segment, the associated GAR and TAS. A 16 deeper strategy to grow this segment is covered in our Think Big Plan. 17 Note: TAS data used for segmentation has data errors (e.g. Web3 applications, which represent Crypto, GAR is more than TAS). For the sake of consistency, we have used the same data 18 used for segmentation. Directionally, the spread of TAS and the overall numbers are realistic and should give a good idea of the industry. 19 1.2 Headwinds/ Tailwinds: 20 There are significant tailwinds in Banking, where rapid growth in digital payments and adoption of digital channels (post Covid) is 21 driving digital transformation projects across the industry. This largely drove the Fintech growth over the last few years, helped by 22 the exponential growth in UPI (digital B2C and C2C/P2P payments). UPI volume in Dec 2023 touched $208B (11.4B transactions). 23 UPI volume has grown at a CAGR of 168% from 2017-18 from $12B to $1.7T. Banks are increasingly looking at Cloud-first strategies 24 to drive Innovation as well as build resiliency and scalability for highly volatile workloads like payments. Indian FS market is still 25 largely underserved (only ~70% of Indians have Bank accts, with credit & insurance at <10% penetration), which provides a large 26 runway for growth for FS industry in India, beyond the current TAS. Large Private sector FS players are investing in modernizing 27 platforms to plan capacity for future growth driven by favourable demographics, and increasingly looking at cloud-native 28 architectures to drive business agility or lower costs (E.g.: Postgres is becoming the first choice over Oracle for CX workloads). Banks 29 are investing in in-house build capabilities esp. for Digital platforms, which positions AWS favourably due to our developer & startup 30 ecosystem in India. There are a few headwinds that might slow down revenue growth that are 31 largely uncontrollable. 1/ Cost. There is an intense focus on Cost Optimization as customers try to 32 put more governance on cloud costs. Cheap labour costs and favourable on-prem pricing is not 33 enabling a significant price differential in the early stages of the cloud journey. Traditional and 34 new players, like Adani and Jio, are coming up with competitive price-points for FS customers to 35 continue investing on-prem. 2/ Geo-political/ Regulatory uncertainty. Inconsistent policies (E.g. 36 Central Banking Digital Currency not allowed to go on public cloud; SEBI, Securities Regulator, has been sending mixed messages in 37 private conversations with regulated entities on moving critical workloads to public cloud) have created ambiguity and hence 38 cautiousness in any rapid movement to the cloud. RBI (Banking regulator) has also recently indicated an intent to offer its own cloud 39 facility for hosting critical workloads. Geo-political risks and an implicit nudge for an India cloud (owned/operated by an Indian 40 company) option is increasing complexity. NBFCs have also come under intense regulatory scrutiny and have been restricted to 41 grow some aspects (like lending). 3/ FX volatility is driving demand for INR pricing. 4/ Funding winter is expected to continue for 42 most of 2024. 2023 saw a precipitous drop in funding from $9.6B in 2021, $6B in 2022 to $2.1B in 2023 (Source: Tracxn), leading to 43 muted growth expectation of Fintech revenue in 2024. Crypto industry is also on the decline owing to regulatory ambiguity (Crypto 44 customers have already reduced usage by an avg. 12% in 2023). 5/ Increase in competitive activity, who are trying to reduce the 45 gap with aggressive pricing options, and INR pricing. Most Indian FSIs are India-focused and don’t have a large multinational 46 engagement. They don’t have a FX risk from their core business and do not want that to be introduced because of their IT spend. 47 1.3 Cloud/customer/segment maturity  48 Banks will continue to provide the largest runway for growth (45% of FSI TAS, 4% wallet share in terms of GAR), as seen in section 49 1.1. The journey started in 2020 and only private sector banks have begun their move to the cloud over the last 3 years. Public 50 Sector Banks (~$700M+ TAS) are poised to begin their journey this year and will be a Think Big bet for driving FS growth. Most 51 private sector insurers (e.g. ICICI Lombard, HDFC Life, BAGIC) and Capital Markets (e.g. Angel One, Motilal Oswal, HDFC AMC) 52 entities have moved most workloads to the cloud through Lift+Shift migrations. Modernization and migration of core systems, 53 Innovation, Data modernization, Gen AI will be key focus in these sectors. Private sector banks continue to be large buyers of ISV 54 solutions but are also starting to transform themselves into builders (e.g. HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, Kotak Bank), starting with CX and 55 Sub-Segment# AccountsTTM GAR$TASGAR % TASBanking53$56,276,852$1,302,471,8444%NBFC31$14,596,645$534,057,5403%Insurance41$35,987,140$450,006,8998%Payments64$200,910,108$356,767,63456%Capital Markets/Securities55$53,861,145$243,787,84822%Financial Services - Other13$6,983,625$17,955,57739%Web3 Apps (Crypto)5$18,408,776$17,560,996105%Software2$956,871$1,588,17060%Grand Total264$387,981,163$2,924,196,50813%

They are builders who are driving Innovation through technology.  57 1.4 Market segment positioning / Noteworthy 2023 progress/successes 58 2023 was a year of many firsts including large PPA’s with 2 of the Top 3 private sector Banks (HDFC Bank: $80M/5Y; Axis Bank: 59 $90M/5Y– largest for any CSP in India Enterprise FSI); Large SRRP deals with Zscaler at HDFC Bank (TCV: $40M/5Y) and ICICI Bank 60 (TCV: $62M/6Y), first Salesforce SRRP deal in AWS India at HDFC Bank, Deployment of secondary envt of CRMNext at Axis Bank. We 61 also saw acceleration of modernization of core workloads (e.g. TCS BaNCS Policy Administration System at SBI  GIC, and core digital 62 platforms like Optimus, Mobile+ Net banking, at IDFC First Bank, Thought Machine, Core Banking for new digital products, at IDFC 63 First and PayU). In Analytics, Amazon Redshift became a platform of choice at Angel One, Kotak Bank and Motilal Oswal. With 64 Fintech customers, there was significant progress around  1/ Graviton adoption (improved from ~5.5% in Jan-23 to 8.9% in Nov-23) 65 2/ Improved PPA  Coverage from 79%  to 86% of 2023 revenue; 24 (out of 52) customers under PPA. Wins: PayU ($60M/3Y), 66 Razorpay ($50M/3Y), Navi ($20M/5Y), and Bharatpe ($18M/3Y); 3/ Enterprise Support Penetration: 16 (out of top 20) on ES with 3 67 net-new wins in 2023. YTD Nov, strategic services adoption by Fintechs have grown 17% (~$54M in 2022 to ~$63M in 2023).   68 1.5 What is the 3Y/5Y vision? What will you be doing in 2024 to get closer to that vision? 69 We aspire to grow the FSI business to $1B in 5 years. Beyond the BAU Sales plays, we will continue to focus on the FSI Industry 70 Solutions IGA to drive business outcomes on AWS; deepen our Fintech engagement, increasing our wallet share by driving more 71 Pan-Amazon synergies and hence stickiness to AWS; making big bets around Public Sector Banks ($700M+ TAS) and 72 transformational DC Exits in a few large Private Sector banks, to drive significant growth in 3-5 years. Details in Think Big section.  73 2.0 FY23 Summary, observations, and learnings 74 2.1 Overall performance - vertical/segment 75 As highlighted in section 1.2, the 76 Banking segment is driving a healthy 77 growth ($53M, 68% Nov’23 YTD, YoY) 78 as the largest private sector banks 79 adopt a cloud first strategy to drive 80 Innovation, deliver better CX. Banks 81 have taken a measured approach to cloud adoption and have not embarked on large lift and shift initiatives. Instead, they are taking 82 a modernization approach to determine which applications need to be moved to the cloud. As applications have gotten complex 83 (like CRM, Loan management systems), the project and sales life cycles have increased (by 14-16%), leading to a slower growth rate 84 than years past (where growth was driven by non-critical applications). Public Sector Banks have just begun to consider cloud for 85 some of their transformation initiatives. We won the first few opportunities (CRMNext at Punjab National Bank, $3M/5Y) and Union 86 Bank of India ($600K ARR) that will begin their deployment journey in 2024. Insurance continues to have mixed growth ($28M, 17% 87 Nov’23 YTD, YoY) with some large accounts HDFC Life ($4.7M , -5% Nov’23 YTD YoY), BAGIC+BALIC ($2.65M, 14% Nov’23 YTD YoY), 88 ICICI Pru Life ($2.2M, 4% Nov’23 YTD YoY), in the final stages of their migrations. The current growth is being driven by core 89 modernization and data initiatives at Acko General Insurance ($2.1M, 86% Nov’23 YTD YoY), Max Life ($2.2M, 27% Nov’23 YTD YoY), 90 Star Health, ($1.3M, 52% Nov’23 YTD YoY). Capital Markets (50% YoY), with seen strong growth in 6 of the top 8 accounts, driven 91 by new app development and data initiatives at Angel Broking ($7M, 61% Nov’23 YTD YoY), DC Exit at HDFC AMC ($1.1M , 336% 92 Nov’23 YTD YoY). Fintech overall has slowed down due to the funding winter, as evidenced in section 1.2. E.g.: Razorpay (Usage -93 10% YoY), Cred ( -8%), Upstox (-19%), Simpl (-17%). However, the trends are mixed with sectors like Capital Markets (Quadeye: 94 +112%, Zerodha-32%), Digital Lending (Navi:+183%, Truebalance:+147%), and Insurtech (Acko:+77% Policy Bazar:+32%) have seen 95 growth while others like Crypto (Industry:-21%), and Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL, Slice:- 17%) have declined. Fintech customers like 96 Quadeye grew by entering new markets; Payments startups were focused on cross/upselling to their existing customers. E.g.: Navi 97 entered into insurance, mutual funds & wealth management and Zerodha diversified into fund management. Paytm growth was 98 also aided by consolidation of workloads on to AWS (~$10M ARR), from regions outside India. Apart from shutting down non-99 profitable business, Fintechs have also taken hard measures such as RIF(Reductions in workforce) e.g.: Cred (35%), PayU (6%), 100 Polygon (20%), CoinDCX (25%) to increase the runway in their business.  101 2.2 Key callouts on team structure, tenure, culture, diversity, connections scores, hiring, RA/URA 102 The FS team comprises of 38 resources (35 BIS), which includes 3 FLMs (tenure ranging from 6-10 years at 103 Amazon); 33 ICs (30 BIS, 3 Women); 1 FSI ISV BD and 1 Program Manager. 39% of the team is less than 2 years 104 at Amazon, while 42% of the team is over 4 years at Amazon, making it a healthy mix of relatively new and 105 tenured Amazonians. Diversity Ratio needs to be improved and we will be intentional in the hiring of TBHs. There 106 are also 2 employees currently on Pivot and 1 employee (RA) serving a notice period. All managers are new to 107 their teams and connection score are not available, right now, that reflects the sentiment of the new org. FSI org 108 has 4 L5s, 24 L6s and 7 L7s, apart from 3 L7Ms as FLMs. The 3 FLMs have 9 (ENT FSI Focus), 10 (Fintech) and 13 (ENT FSI Deep) as 109 span of controls. FSI Segment leader will have 6 people reporting directly as outlined at the beginning of this section, with the 110 addition of the AM for SBI, who will report directly for span of control purposes.

We have been intentional about our team’s wellbeing/development and 112 executing it through 3 pillars 1/FSI Weekly Connect: We bring the FSI sellers together every week to collaborate with functional 113 teams like Partner, ProServe, Training, Marketing team etc. to make our FSI customer successful in their cloud journey. 2/FSI 114 Falcons: FSI AMs, SAs and BDSI teams come together monthly to learn and share insights on new use cases deployed, customer 115 innovations, Progress made with our FSI customers and go deep with some of marquee wins and solutions to make it a repeatable. 116 We will continue both of these engagements in FY24. 3/Upskilling and Career Development: We initiated the ENT Enablement 117 Friday series in 2023 to upskill/enable our team on themes like FSI Specific solutions/ offerings, Industry Specific solutions, Strategic 118 Services, Executive Engagement and Sales Skills sessions led by FE and Industry teams. In FY24, we will plan 20 such enablement 119 workshops and drive programs like FSI/Fintech Ready Program GenAI Refresher Program, Growth Mindset Program. FSI Path’shala’ 120 is a monthly enablement mechanism where we invite strategic ISVs to present their FSI Industry Solutions and USPs. Objective is to 121 equip AWS account teams with functional understanding of the solution and be able to make an initial pitch to FSI customers. Last 122 year we conducted 15 FSI Path'shala sessions and this year we plan to conduct 20. 123 2.3 Successes / performance outcomes against strategy (strategic services) 124 Migrations, Data/ Analytics/ AIML, ISV solutions were key sales plays in 2023. ISV progress is covered in the IGA update. Migrations 125 continue to work well, driving good growth in ENT FSI. Against a 2023 stretch target of $36M migration ARR, we have closed 21 126 (30% of ENT) MAPs with a migration ARR of $51.4M (143% of stretch target). Major migration wins have been from Insurance ( 6 127 out of 21 wins) and Banks (9 out of 21 wins) and rest from NBFC (4, including 1 from Bajaj Finance Ltd, Microsoft’s largest NBFC 128 account), Capital markets(2). In the Fintech space, we have identified 5 Migration prospects (Phone pay, Billdesk, Paisa Bazaar, 129 Wimbo, CC Avenue)  with $25M TAS in our cohort where we plan to close min 2 MAP wins ($3M) in 2024 and acquire all 5 customers 130 ($20M) by FY26. The FSI AI/ML revenue grew by 16% ($1.85M, Nov’23 YTD), driven by 27% growth in the Fintech segment ($785K 131 Nov’23 YTD), led by Paytm ($380K Nov’23 YTD, 100% YoY). The FSI Ent segment grew at 10%($1.3M Nov’23 YTD) owing to degrowth 132 in IDFC First Bank (Nov YTD, $572K, -17% YoY, owing to EDP and Sagemaker Savings plan discounts) and RBL Bank ($90K Nov’23 133 YTD, -52% YoY, due to reduced experimentation and stopping usage of Transcribe). The Analytics revenue grew by 25% ($17.8M, 134 Nov’23 YTD), driven by a 76% growth in FSI Ent segment ($7M, Nov’23 YTD) led by Angel Broking ($1.1M, Nov’23 YTD, 313% YTD, 135 YoY). 2023 saw a healthy 75% Partner attach rate for the Ent FSI segment, up from 70% in 2022, led by collaboration with GSI’s like 136 Deloitte (Indusind Bank, Axis Bank), Accenture (AU Small Finance Bank), TCS (Max Life). In FY’23 YTD (till Oct’23), strategic services 137 contribution to Fintech accounts contribution has increased by 9% (2023 YTD at $51.5M vs FY22 YTD at $47.5M); Database is at 138 $24.7M 2023 YTD, 10% YoY, Containers  at $17.5M 2023 YTD, 14% YoY, Analytics at $8.67M 2023 YTD, -4% YoY and AI/ML is at 139 $0.61M 2023 YTD, 24% YoY.

We have since 145 reworked our forecasts, identified 146 opportunities, worked on pipeline targets for a 147 Fast start (see Appendix 2), factored early outcomes of some Big Bets (FSI ISV, PSB) which now translates to a 22% YoY growth rate 148 (40% ENT FSI and 10% Fintech), which is significantly better than the Nov Forecasts, but still carries risk in Fintech Forecast, 149 especially. We are identifying a PTG for the remaining gap over the next few weeks. In summary, we continue to expect growth in 150 the Banking and Capital Markets verticals. Insurance will be muted but will grow at a moderate pace. There is limited baseline 151 erosion in Enterprise FSI accounts (E.g. NSE $2.55M, RBL $1.57M) but there are headwinds in Fintech. In Fintech, Quadeye (Entered 152 new markets, and crypto) and Paytm (consolidation from other regions to India) had one-time events in 2023 that will not recur in 153 FY24. We expect our big bets to start paying dividends in FY25 and beyond and are confident of reaching $1B in 5Y. 154 Revenue Concentration: Top 19% (32 out of 171) of 155 the accounts, when viewed at a parent level, drive 80% 156 of FSI Revenue. At the child level, this translates to Top 157 17% of the 264 accounts driving 80% of the revenue. 158 However, the long tail of FSI is growing at a much faster 159 rate than the top accounts, which should help reduce concentration. 160 3.1 Sales motion implementation and verticalization 161 Sales Motions: The FSI Deep (ENT) segment ($66M YTD Nov’23), comprises 13 Banks (~$1B TAS, 7 PSU, 6 Private Sector Banks) 162 including subsidiaries and 1 large NBFC group (Bajaj Finserv) and will be addressed with 14 AMs (12 BIS, 1 open HC, 1 to be raised), 163 and 14 SAs. To drive optimal coverage, accounts >500K ARR will have 1:1 AM to account coverage ratio, with 5 Greenfield PSU Banks 164 at 1:2.5 coverage ratio. The key pillars of our GTM will include: 1/ Influence the cultural transformation of the largest FSIs in India: 165 To become the innovation partner of their choice by positively influencing their culture, we will invest in long term executive 166 relationships with CXOs (aligning exec sponsors from AWS), leverage CXO engagement mechanisms such as COI/WB to help them 167

Amazon Confidential  Page 4 of 12 accelerate their pace of innovation (making it real with Prototyping and Hackathons), Envisioning workshops/LFA/EBCs to better 168 unpack their transformation agendas to align better to their goals, and leverage BCAP/GSI Partners to build credible transformation 169 proposals for these large FS behemoths. 2/ Migration & modernization focus of ISV workloads (E.g.: Lentra/Mindgate at HDFC 170 Bank, Finacle Lite at Axis Bank etc) will continue to drive in-year revenue with FSI IGA helping us unlock better GTM and cloud-171 native stack readiness of these ISVs. Our investment in CSMs coupled with ES will help us accelerate execution 3/ CX and Digital 172 Banking: To harness a key trend of these large Banks investing in in-house builders to esp. build CX & digital platforms, our focus 173 on T&C, Account Based Marketing & enablement (to be detailed in an account plan) will help us build skills and nurture AWS 174 champions across the breadth of their organization. 4/ Public Sector Banks: Within the PSU Bank space, we have begun to make 175 headway with the creation of a dedicated landing zone at State Bank of India (India’s largest Bank), CRMNext win(5Y/$3M) at Punjab 176 National Bank(3rd largest PSU) and Cloud transformation VMCA win at Union Bank of India($600K ARR). For 2024, unlocking PSBs 177 is a big bet, the plan for which is elaborated in our Think Big plan. 178 FSI Focus (ENT) consists of 118 accounts (child a/cs) spread across 9 territories (with 1 dedicated GRN territory with ~24 accounts) 179 with $59M TTM revenue, spread across sub-industries as 44 banking (or lending/NBFCs), 21 capital market cos, 18 insurers and rest 180 as other misc. financial services providers. The average coverage ratio in engaged territories is 1:11 in ENG and 1:24 in GRN. The 181 territories are regionally spread as Mumbai (5), Chennai (1), BLR (1) and Delhi (1) with an optimal mix of Focus core and select 182 accounts. One territory in Mumbai is predominantly focused on Capital Markets, while the rest are a mixed across sub verticals. FSI 183 Focus sales motion will help customer drive their transformation goals by 1/ Driving industry specific solutions, esp. with LOB 184 stakeholders across Digital banking, lending solutions, CX, risk management, underwriting, claims, analytics, etc. These solutions 185 will be tailored with partners (SIs/GSIs) or vertical ISVs driving a co-sell motion or migrating/upgrading solutions from on-prem to 186 cloud. 2/ Migrations and modernization will continue to be a focus to win new tactical workloads or establish a long-term cloud 187 roadmap to eventually drive DC exit opportunities; 3/ Partners: Align with specific partners (SI/GSIs –atleast 2 per customer) 188 captured in a territory plan (to be completed before Mar 1st) and driven by PSMs for proactive interlock and cadence. 4/ Marketing 189 & Innovation Programs: Leverage FS industry specific marketing programs (3rd party Industry events, ExecLeaders, FS Symposium 190 & roundtables) to drive net new contact acquisition or nurture exec relationships. To better align with cultural transformation 191 agenda of our customers, DI (both 1:1 & IXA format) will be key to help us become the preferred Innovation partner. (Appendix 7).  192 FSI Fintech business consists of 4 Deep accounts (3 from Payment and 1 from Capital Markets, with $119M TAS and $94.6M TTM 193 revenue) and the Focus cohort consists of 51 accounts (37 in Payments, 5 in Crypto, 4 Capital Markets & 5 Insurers) spread across 194 6 territories with $355M TAS and $99M TTM revenue in 2023, to be covered by 6 AMs and 5 SAs across 6 territories. 2024 Focus: 195 1/ Increase our Share of Wallet (SOW): With increased competitive activity in the last 18 months, we will continue to focus on 196 increasing our 79% share in our top 20 fintech accounts, which contribute to 86% of Fintech revenue. This year, we will target to 197 have a PPA with all Top 20 customers. We currently have 19 but 6 of them are up for renewal in 2024. (Details in Appendix 8). 2/ 198 Strengthen Executive connects: We will continue our focus to build deeper connects with our top 20 customers esp. with 199 Founder/CEO/CTO relationships through 1:1 Executive connects, AWS marketing forums for builders (Mumbai Summit, ReInvent, 200 AI Conclave etc.) and leveraging existing Marketing programs such as  the FSI Symposium. We will also leverage One Amazon 201 initiatives to drive Pan-Amazon synergies, e.g.: A.in relationships with PayU for Payment processing and Razorpay for Digital Suite 202 offerings. 3/ Operational excellence: We will complete Value maps and Account plans for top 20 customers by 15th Feb with 203 operational cadences to drive execution of the plans. Cost Optimisation will be a priority for our top customers with a goal to 204 improve the COI score from avg. of 63 to 73 by end of FY24, also increase the Graviton adoption from 8.9% to 13%. 4/ Focus on 205 next set of High Growth Accounts: We will identify the “Next 15” (from Focus) accounts & target opportunities in whitespaces. E.g. 206 Analytics/AIML opportunities in 5 of our 20 accounts that are not using AWS native services. 5 Migration prospects (PhonePe, 207 BillDesk, Paisabazaar, Wimbo, CCAvenue) and drive $3M in 2024.  208 Partner Motion: Partner attach in ENT FSI (excluding Fintechs) has grown to 75% in 2023 (vs. 70.1% in 2022). We aim to take this 209 further to 80%+ in 2024. Fintechs, who are largely builders had a partner attach of 33.2% (vs. 28% in 2022). In 2024 our partner 210 strategy will revolve around the following 4 key pillars in FSI: 1/ Proactively Partnering with GSIs to drive transformational 211 outcomes: Our engagement with GSIs has grown significantly (over 70% YoY) in 2023 for 3 out of top 5 GSIs. Overall GSI pipeline 212 grew over 137% YoY to $21.89M, reflecting both GSI interest, AWS Sellers engaging partners pro-actively and the preference from 213 customers in transformational opportunities. Some large transformational projects with GSIs in 2023 included HDFC Bank (Deloitte 214 cloud consulting), Bajaj Finserv Group (TCS), Equitas Bank (IBM, digital banking build). PSMs will own and drive Partner plans with 215 proactive interlock with key GSIs (at least 1 incumbent and 1 challenger GSI in every ENT deep and 20% of ENT Focus accounts by 216 end Q1; drive interlock with at least 1 BCAP per Deep account in H1). 2/ SI Partners for migrations & modernization: Key SI and 217 regional consulting Partners provide us scale and execution capabilities for migration & modernization with many also bringing in 218 FSI expertise on applications, process knowhow or security/regulatory compliance capabilities. We will identify 7 priority SI partners 219 (WIP: CXIO, Rackspace, ACC, Lumiq, Quadra, Ganit, Oneture) with who we will drive maximum proactive sales interlocks as well as 220 maximise 1:1 FS LT connect + cadence to build traction for better coverage. 3/ FSI ISV Partners: FSI ISV partners continue to be the 221 backbone of ENT FSIs in India, this motion elaborated in the FSI IGA section. We will also be working closely with 1/2 partners (like 222 TCS) on our Think Big opportunity to enable a DC Exit at large banks, which will require a multi-year transformational approach. 223 JAN 2024 | FY23 OP2 – FSI 
Amazon Confidential  Page 5 of 12 3.2 FSI Industry Solutions IGA Update:  224 FSI Industry solutions IGA objectives: 1/ Identify, Cultivate and Enable FSI ISVs to build cloud enabled Industry Solutions on AWS, 225 and 2/ Joint GTM of these Industry Solutions to drive value to ISV and FSI customers. 226 2023 performance vs. plan: Attainment in 2023 of $1.3M (60%). Gap in attainment due to: 1/ HDFC-CRMNext ($3M ARR) moving 227 to 2024, 2/ HDFC-Mindgate deferment ($1.7M ARR), 3/ ICICI Bank-Intellect Design moving to 2024 ($600K ARR), 4/ PNB-CRMNext 228 moving to 2024 ($600K ARR). These will provide a fast start for 2024. Another learning is the time required to align an ISV. It takes 229 3-5 months and FSI sales cycle is longer (4-6 months). Ramp time for revenue is longer than anticipated. IGA has strengthened our 230 Industry Solutions messaging to customers by bringing the entire gamut of FSI relevant partner products mapped to FSI application 231 landscape. During 2023, IGA team identified 90 ISVs, targeted 55 and connected 45 ISVs across 25+ areas (Appendix 9). Enabled 232 field teams with 14 Path’shala’ sessions, 50+ SA sessions and Joint GTM. This translated into 137 opportunities created across 67 233 unique FSI customers and 56 opportunities launched with ARR value of $4M. Key launched opportunities include CRMNext-Axis 234 Bank, Mindgate-Yes Bank, Pennant-Piramal Finance, Pennant-Avanse Finance, Decimal-AU SFB and Intellect-IDFC First. 235 2024 goals and execution plan: With Dec’23 exit MRR at $297K, we will reach an aggregate $4.9M from beginning till ’24 end. Will 236 need incremental $3.2M to meet the overall 3Y IGA target. Execution Plan to meet this: 1/ Pipeline of $7.4M in place with $1.7M in 237 Bus Val + Tech Val + Committed stage, 2/ We will execute a fast start program to accelerate closure of the opportunities in pipeline: 238 HDFC-CRMNext (first year ARR of $800K), HDFC-Mindgate (ARR $1.7M), Axis Bank-TSYS (ARR $960K), IDFC-Montran ($400K), 3/ We 239 now observe a pattern of deal replication which will support non-linear growth during 2024 e.g. CRMNext (HDFC, Axis, SBI, Canara, 240 PNB, Muthoot, JK Bank), Pennant (Piramal, Avanse, HDFC, Axis Finance, UNO Bank, Unity SFB, Ecofy, Vistaar), Mindgate (HDFC, Yes 241 Bank, IndusInd, RBL, Kotak), Liquitics (Kotak, ICICI, IndusInd, Unity SFB, Bandhan), 4/ In 2024, we will be running with 1.5 HC (1 AM 242 and 1 SA distributed between IGA and FSI accounts). Beyond revenue, IGA has a long-term impact by 1/ gaining mindshare with 243 ISVs to recommend AWS e.g. Mindgate (aligned to Azure earlier) is now AWS-First; CRMNext quoted 4 RFPs with AWS in 2023; 244 Pennant is recommending AWS as preferred partner 2/ identifying niche AWS-ready FSI industry solutions which were out of 245 purview earlier e.g. Liquitics, Coherent Global, VirSoftech, Veefin etc. 3/ entering into industry solution conversation with FSI 246 customers. Our mission is to make this the best FSI sales team in the industry, highly competent in solution-selling to our customers. 247 3.3 Q1’24 Fast Start  248 FSI in 2024, combines ENT FSI and Fintech, will focus on: 1/Account transition plan: New account team introductions and knowledge 249 transfers to be concluded by Jan 31st. 2/ Exec Connect: In order to drive deeper strategic ties and stronger account relationship we 250 will have a connect between Segment leader/ FLM and senior stakeholders of our top 30 accounts (that drive 70% of the revenue) 251 by Q1 and reach top 45 accounts that drive 80% of the revenue by end of H1. 3/ Focus on GenAI : We will explore (5th Feb- 1st Mar) 252 and execute GenAI opportunities in our Top 25 accounts with the support of our SA team with a target to pursue 15 Qualified+ 253 Opps. 4/ Team enablement: To benefit from Industry alignment model we need to train/upskill our team with relevant industry 254 knowledge/ available sales plays. We will work with Field Enablement team and Industry BD/Specialist team to roll out training 255 calendar and enablement for the year. 5/ Partner led Sales play: a/Co sell motion: Drive programmatic (19th Feb -29th Mar) co-sell 256 by focusing on five domains (Storage, Security, Analytics). b/ SRRP Prospecting campaign with 4 identified SRRP partners (PaloAlto, 257 Zscaler, MongoDb, Trendmicro) to build a SRRP pipeline in Q1’24 ($2M creation). 6/ Industry Specific Sales Plays with ISV solutions 258 (CRMNext, Penant, Mindgate) to provide solution-based offering to our customers with a target to create $5 M pipe. 259 4.0 Think Big plan: Build an integrated $1B FSI business (5X growth) by driving deeper penetration  260 Incremental revenue potential of $250M-$300M over 3Y. With rapid digitization of key infrastructure like payments and faster 261 adoption of digital channels like eBanking and Mobile, Banks have had to innovate at a faster pace than ever before to deliver 262 differentiated customer experiences and build higher resiliency on core systems. This has led Banks to embrace technology as a 263 core tenet to drive business outcomes. This has given an opportunity to explore bold DC Exit opportunities at some large banks to 264 drive deeper penetration in FSI ($200M+ ARR, $2.6B TAS across segments). FSI can be an engine of growth for India. While we will 265 continue to engage early to build cloud native solutions with Fintechs, the GTM plan for ENT FSI customers will involve a 4-pronged 266 approach focused on the highest TAS opportunities to build a $1B FSI business. 1/ Data Center (DC) exit program: Currently, only 267 about 10% of core banking/insurance workloads are on the cloud, and targeted DC exits are crucial to increase adoption. We will 268 focus on the top 16 FSI customers across banking (e.g. HDFC, ICICI, SBI, Axis, Yes Bank) & insurance (e.g. Max Life, BAGIC/BALIC, 269 ICICI Prudential Life), and target to win 60% of TAS/$100M+ ARR each, over the next 3Y-5Y (regulatory guidelines mandate a multi-270 cloud approach, thereby limiting penetration). This approach will require sustained CEO level executive engagements, tight 271 #OneAWS execution, & customized incentive programs to build early traction. We will also need to invest in a Business Development 272 team that has experience driving such large-scale DC Exits, including crafting the ideal commercial construct. 2/ Partner with leading 273 ISVs & GSIs to modernize & deploy FSI SaaS solutions: Currently, almost all traditional ENT FSIs leverage core banking applications 274 from GSIs/ISVs (e.g. TCS BaNCS, Infosys/ Finacle, Oracle FlexCube, GroupAsia & LifeAsia from DXC), but these solutions are 275 predominantly on-prem and are heavily dependent on an Oracle stack. This presents an opportunity to migrate & modernize these 276 applications (with support from our WW service teams), while engaging with the FSIs to deploy them, and will require a cohesive, 277 tripartite GTM approach between the ISV/GSIs, the banks and AWS. 3/ Continue engaging with regulators and strengthen AWS’ 278 role in “Make in India”. In addition to focused regulatory engagement to ensure cloud adoption by FSIs is viewed favourably by the 279 JAN 2024 | FY23 OP2 – FSI 
Amazon Confidential  Page 6 of 12 regulators, we need to build evidence for AWS’ role in the “Make in India” narrative beyond having local data centers (e.g., MSFT-280 Jio, OCI-Airtel), given the focus on self-reliance and an India Cloud. The Indian government is actively considering its options for a 281 “sovereign cloud”, to have more strategic control over cloud providers providing infrastructure to public sector and regulated 282 industries. Partnering with a reputed conglomerate like TATA Sons to build such an “India Cloud” offering will be crucial to ensure 283 AWS continues to be a player in the Indian FS industry. [Ask]:1/  Investment in a senior project management headcount to build 284 and manage an execution plan, including driving partner conversations, in collaboration with the PSM and GSI teams.2/ AWS WW 285 and APJ leadership commitment to drive regular (twice a year, once the project is conceptualized) interactions with CEOs of at least 286 4 banks (SBI, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank). A T2T2T (that includes partner CEO connect) will be crucial to accelerate such a 287 bold initiative in India, where cloud adoption in Banking is still very nascent.3/ A strategic partnership with a conglomerate like 288 TATA sons, to drive India Cloud offerings. 4/ Drive momentum in Public Sector Banks ($700M TAS): India has 10 Public sector Banks 289 (PSB) who contribute to 48% of the Retail-MSME credit market in India. Out of these, 6 PSBs will covered as Deep accounts (2 290 engaged – SBI, Canara; and 4 GF – BOB, PNB, BOI, UBI). The PSBs are publicly listed for-profit commercial organizations, but with 291 government shareholding, have unique organization structures (most top execs have a lifetime tenure at PSBs), complex & 292 consensus driven decision-making processes (via strictly defined RFP processes) and have traditionally been slow to adopt any new 293 technology compared to Private sector Banks in India (we est. a 18-24 months lag in tech adoption). However, with Private Banks 294 on a firm journey to public cloud adoption with material workloads, we have seen early signs of interest from PSBs to get started. 295 We will drive momentum in this sector to deliver ~4M in 2024 and $60M over 5 years. A detailed write-up on PSB is in Appendix 6. 296 5.0 Summary of key risks, dependencies and asks (beyond the asks for Big Bets): 297 1/ Constant Currency offerings for 5 years. As evidenced in the conversations with CAMS, HDFC Life (and it is expected to be an ask 298 by Public Sector Banks, as we make inroads), a 5-year INR pricing commercial construct is increasingly becoming critical to win in 299 India. 2/ In order to drive more revenue, expedite availability of MP and other strategic services (like Gen AI) in India. 3/ Competitive 300 ProServe pricing (as compared to other CSPs and large GSIs) will become a key requirement to move business critical workloads to 301 AWS at large FSIs. Indian FSIs, who are yet to become proficient builders, frequently require OEM skin in the game for mission 302 critical projects. Anecdotal feedback suggests we can be up to 2x competition currently, which is not scalable. This will also be 303 critical to win more standalone ProServe opportunities vs relying too heavily on PPA Attach. ProServe should also have the same 304 funding levers that are available for partners, to ensure parity 4/ Marketing: (a) Adequate funding for in-account initiatives for Deep 305 and some Focus-Select accounts.(b) An in-person FSI Forum for the top 25-30 FSI (across Enterprise and Fintech) stakeholders, to 306 enable networking, share learnings, deepen CXO connects and showcase our large transformation successes. 5/ Incremental 307 headcount: (a)  Specialist BD/SA pod for Gen AI and 1 Specialist BD/SA pod for Data/ Analytics, dedicated to FSI.(b) Incremental SA 308 coverage of 8 SAs (3 for Deep, 3 for Fintech, 1 for Focus and 1 for FSI ISV) to ensure adequate coverage (c) Dedicated program 309 manager to support FSI initiatives. 6/ Increased CSM coverage for all MAP 2.0 across Deep and Focus; CSM for every Deep account 310 billing more than $5M ARR. 7/ SSOE support to operationalize revenue sharing across FSI and ISV/SUP teams to drive better 311 collaboration between the teams. 8/ A specific comp for Public sector Banks in Deep Sales motion. These banks will take 2-3 years 312 to ramp-up owing to the slow bureaucratic processes in these organizations. Requesting a 2-3 year sales plan for AMs covering 313 Banks like SBI, Canara Bank, that are no longer in Greenfield as group entities are billing with AWS. Greenfield tag is assessed at the 314 parent level, leading to these 0 biller banks to not be eligible for a Greenfield compensation plan. 9/ TAS data used for segmentation 315 has data errors (e.g. IndusInd Bank, the 5th largest private sector bank, is shown with $11M TAS, while its microfinance subsidiary, 316 Bharat Financial, is show to have $29M TAS). Inaccuracies in TAS data has led to 2 large accounts moving to Scale (e.g. Indian 317 Overseas Bank, Indian Bank are among the top 10 Public sector banks in the country). Request for a window to correct these errors 318 for some obvious accounts. 319 6.0 Conclusion: 320 2023 was a challenging year for FSI. There have been multiple headwinds like intense focus on CO (over 50% of customers), loss of 321 a large account like Dhani (introduced a gap of $3.2M), Zscaler claw back of $3.8M (Full year) and some significant disruptive events 322 in the Fintech segment (covered earlier in the doc). However, there are significant tailwinds and FSI continues to be in a position to 323 drive good growth, if some big bets materialize and some of the regulatory and policy uncertainties are solved for. We also expect 324 a resurgence of the Fintech sector in 18-24 months time, when more investments are likely to come into this sector. We strongly 325 believe we will continue to outpace the India growth rate in this segment, and can move the integrated Enterprise and Fintech 326 vertical to a 30%+ growth in the next 24 months. The team enjoys high Earn Trust with customer stakeholders across all sub-327 verticals. We will continue to be intentional about retaining that trust. Senior stakeholders from 2 large banks remarked that they 328 have never seen any other technology vendor provide such support.  329 7.0 Frequently Asked Questions 330 7.1 What “dogs not barking” worry you?  331 1/ Ambiguity around Regulatory/ Policy direction around India Cloud and the ability to host business critical workloads on US HQed 332 CSPs (NSE who have scaled down their cloud footprint). Currently, UIDAI is not approving the use of cloud for Aadhar Vault and 333 AUA/KUA services. 2/ A push by regulators to explore cloud ready and CSP agnostic solutions, potentially slowing the down the 334 JAN 2024 | FY23 OP2 – FSI 
Amazon Confidential  Page 7 of 12 adoption of our cloud native services, the core of our modernization strategy. We continue to work closely with the PP team on 335 both topics. We will need a concerted effort, in collaboration with PS teams, to address the same.  336 7.2 How are competitors innovating in your area?  337 Competitors are relying on aggressive discounts to win targeted workloads (E.g. GCP at HDFC Ergo) rather than Innovation, with the 338 exception of the OpenAI partnership of MS. Early availability of Gen AI offerings in India (E.g. Vertex AI and Open AI) have provided 339 them a head start with FSI customers, with early whitelisting. We need Bedrock availability in India in early Q1’24. We will leverage 340 the GenAI Innovation Center as a strategic tool to drive business outcomes at large customers. 341 7.3 Which industry vertical initiatives are critical for growth acceleration? What support do you need from BDSI specialists?  342 Growth in Banking, and Retention in Fintech will be key factors to drive growth in FSI. We’ll need BDSI expertise to drive 343 transformational DC exit programs. Continued support of BDSI specialists in Deep and Focus Select will be needed to drive 344 conversations with LoB leaders. BDSI support will also be needed to establish AWS as a thought leader in driving business outcomes 345 in FSI through Industry events and supporting regional and WW CxO initiatives. This is required to bring global learnings to India as 346 well as offer a platform for Indian leaders to showcase their success globally. 347 Appendices 348 Appendix 1: Overview of FSI segment split 349

Amazon Confidential  Page 9 of 12 - Database ($24.7M ARR 2023 YTD, 10% YoY), Containers ($17.5M ARR 2023 YTD, 14% YoY), Analytics ($8.67M ARR 2023 YTD, -4% 362 YoY), AI/ML ($0.61M ARR 2023 YTD, 24% YoY). Key thematic areas of our wins and losses are: a) Containers:  We are able to influence 363 our customers to adopt containers (running on Graviton chips and spot instances) as infrastructure choice to optimize costs and 364 improve utilization. E.g. Upstox migrated their order management platform on EKS with Karpenter ($0.3M YTD Nov, 74% YoY), PayU 365 launched Thought Machine - a Core Banking application on EKS ($0.42M YTD Nov, 61% YoY), CoinDCX launched their DeFi/CeFI on 366 EKS  with Karpenter ($0.6M YTD Nov, 682% YoY), Paytm migrated and re-architected their Auth application from Ali-cloud to EKS 367 ($0.8M YTD Nov, 55% YoY), Polygon re-architected their monolith applications running on EC2 to ECS utilizing Fargate ($0.63M YTD 368 Nov, 2796% YoY). b) Databases: For relational use-cases such as transactional consistency, better performance and scalability, un-369 differentiated heavy lifting of database management and DR capabilities (with Aurora), customers such as Paytm, PayU, BharatPe, 370 Upstox, Razorpay continue to scale on RDS (especially RDS Aurora), thus driving the usage. For NoSQL use-cases, ‘Key-Value pair’ 371 requirement is the most sought after and is extensively used in use-cases such as data-store for micro-services, other applications 372 which can work with eventual consistency model. For such use-cases, Dynamo DB is preferred by customers such as Paytm (Ads 373 team), PayU, CoinDCX due to its performance and serverless architecture. Besides Dynamo DB, we’re also seeing interest from 374 Fintech customers such as Polygon technology, PayU, Navi Technology, Paytm for storing JSON data as documents, thus driving up 375 the utilization of Document DB. c) Analytics: Customers such as Navi Technologies, Paytm, PayU, Slice, Polygon have continued to 376 build and scale their data pipelines using Lakehouse architecture which has driven the usage of Amazon Managed Streaming for 377 Kafka ($1.3M YTD Nov, 36% YoY), EMR ($2.2M YTD Nov, 55% YoY) and Athena ($0.55M YTD Nov, 1% YoY). Slice, a fintech major in 378 Lending business have migrated from Databricks to EMR (#winback from compete ISVs, contributing to EMR ) as EMR is able to 379 offer a better price to performance and more choices of run-times (such as Flink, Trino). Customers undertook various optimization 380 activities on their OpenSearch clusters e.g. archival/periodic maintenance of data, graviton adoption, node re-sizing which led to 381 reduction of OpenSearch usage (and hence 18% YoY drop in revenue). Redshift usage also contracted ($1.17M YTD Nov, -36% YoY) 382 as customers moved to Lakehouse architecture 383 Appendix 5: Gen AI update: 384 Across traditional FSI enterprises, 34 GenAI sessions across 23 FSI customers were conducted. These sessions were attended by 385 600+ attendees and received an avg CSAT of 4.5/5. Apart from customer sessions, 2 enablement sessions conducted for field teams 386 covering the basics of Gen AI, AWS services positioning, demos, industry use cases and partners to engage. These sessions led to 387 discussion of 22 customer uses cases across various customers across 11 FSI customers, among which 5 POCs are currently in 388 progress. Based on the POC discussions 22 customer influences for Amazon Bedrock availability in BOM region were created 389 influencing $517K. SA team has 3 GenAI ambassadors and co-owned the AWS Generative AI Hackathon Playbook . This document 390 helped the SA team conduct 14 Workshops / Hackathons (including Axis Bank) across multiple customers across India and attended 391 by 1200+ participants. Details can be found in https://quip-amazon.com/ZgCoAatZU0yb/AWS-Generative-AI-Hackathon-Playbook-392 for-ENT. There has been executive engagement with service teams at Axis Bank (Bedrock, Kendra & Plato), HDFC Bank (Gen AI 393 focussed EBC), BFL (Gen AI focussed EBC). This has led to PoCs at all these customers, Axis Bank PoC is in progress & at other 394 customers in discussion.  395 Enterprise Wins - From customer adoption of AWS GenAI services, GaadiBazaar (NLP powered query) is in CUG, MaxLife 396 (conversational bot for agents) has been rolled out to be used by 1000 support agents (Winner in AI Conclave) and ICICI Lombard 397 has deployed 2 uses case (Chatbots) in Pre-prod.  Additionally, we have got one of our Focus customers - Fincare Small Finance 398 Bank experimenting with Claude and Titan and will go live in Q1 24 ($100k) 399 Across Fintech : Across 4 deep accounts (Paytm, Quadeye Securities, Razorpay, Cred) - we’ve done 10+ sessions with these 400 customers covering technical topics such as Sagemaker Jumpstart, CodeWhisperer, Bedrock, recently launched services Amazon Q, 401 QuickSight Q (done at Paytm only) resulting in a) Paytm evaluating Sagemaker Jumpstart, Bedrock for use-cases such as 402 Personalised QR generation, document Q&A to improve the productivity of operations team and            Code Whisperer b) Razorpay 403 has successfully completed a PoC of Amazon Bedrock (using Claude V2) to build a merchant assistance bot which will replace a 404 similar bot built with OpenAI. Razorpay is moving out of OpenAI due to better pricing of ClaudeV2 when compared to OpenAI. 405 Razorpay is also evaluating Amazon              Bedrock (Claude) vs OpenAI to create an automated data-dictionary for Data-406 warehousing tables. c) Happay, part of Cred, is evaluating Amazon Bedrock (Claude V2) to build an expense management 407 application. We’ve partnered with WWSO team to drive these GenAI engagements which included activities such as - customer 408 leadership engagement to create mindshare on AWS services, in-account developer engagement thru GenAI hackathons 409 (conducted in 1 each at Paytm and Razorpay), customer enablement, support in technical evaluation of AWS GenAI services and 410 engagement with WW GenAI team. Thru our activities in these accounts, we’ve been able to secure the sponsorship of key customer 411 stakeholders such as CTO, Head of Data Science.  412 Fintech Wins: Our activities in 2023 has resulted in 2 GenAI launches at Paytm. a) Launch of personalised QR code in Paytm app 413 using Stable Diffusion to celebrate Indian Independence Day (ARR $60K) b) Rent agreement analysis using Textract, Sagemaker 414 Jumpstart (Cohere Generate Model - Command) for text summarization, Q&A (ARR $66K).  415 JAN 2024 | FY23 OP2 – FSI 
Amazon Confidential  Page 10 of 12 Challenges/Learnings: a) To comply with data residency requirements, fintech customers are seeking Bedrock availability in BOM 416 region. Additionally, for Bedrock BOM region launch we would need feature parity with N. Virginia region viz. Agents, Knowledge 417 Base as customers like Paytm are seeking these features (PFR link from Paytm account)  b) Prompt engineering in Bedrock is 418 verbose when compared with OpenAI e.g. in situations wherein calculations need to be done, OpenAI can invoke external agents 419 seamlessly without end users doing prompt engineering (such as agents and tools). Customer developers have also mentioned to 420 us that with OpenAI, there is a plethora of tutorials/online guides available. Claude has limited amount of prompt engineering 421 (and other help guides) available and at times this has become a blocker during evaluation stages c) For certain use-cases, we’ve 422 found that OpenAI is able to provide better prediction accuracy when compared with Bedrock e.g. at Razorpay for multi-lingual 423 Auto-eKYC use-case, OpenAI was found to provide a better prediction accuracy when compared to Claude on Amazon Bedrock d) 424 We’ve not been successful in helping our customer adopt Code Whisperer in compete against Github Co-pilot. Feedbacks 425 received – 1/ The number of English words needed by CodeWhisperer to  generate working code sample is verbose when 426 compared to Github Co-pilot  2/ Code Whisperer had been un-able to scan existing code repositories thereby   limiting the 427 developers’ ability to use in daily situations. In FY24, we will re-engage our customers on Code Whisperer basis of the reinvent 428 launches. 429 Appendix 6: Think Big for Public Sector Banks: 430 Plan for 2024: India has 10 Public sector Banks (PSB) who contribute to 48% of the Retail-MSME credit market in India. Out of these, 431 6 PSBs will covered as Deep accounts (2 engaged – SBI, Canara; and 4 GF – BOB, PNB, BOI, UBI), with a combined estimated TAS of 432 ~$900M. The PSBs are publicly listed for-profit commercial organizations, but with government shareholding, have unique 433 organization structures (most top execs have a lifetime tenure at PSBs), complex & consensus driven decision-making processes 434 (via strictly defined RFP processes) and have traditionally been slow to adopt any new technology compared to Private sector Banks 435 in India (we est. a 18-24 months lag in tech adoption). However, with Private Banks on a firm journey to public cloud adoption with 436 material workloads, we have seen early signs of interest from PSBs to get started. Some key beachheads, we currently have in PSBs 437 include Co-lending platform at SBI (Yubi), Canara (SFDC SRRP win via RFP), PNB (CRMNext win, $3M/5Y), UBI (VMCA for T&D, $650K 438 ARR committed stage), Central Bank Housing Finance ($200K ARR), SBI GIC ($3.6M/3Y PPA), Canara HSBC ($200K ARR), etc. To put 439 them on a firm path to AWS cloud, we will drive the following key initiatives in 2024: 1/ Building a security & compliance foundation: 440 In 2024, we will focus on building a strong security & compliance foundation helping build awareness across security and other 441 teams, and help them better understand the operational controls needed on AWS to meet their regulatory needs. This should 442 culminate in building a landing zone across these Banks. Landing zone plans have already been kickstarted at SBI with discussions 443 in progress at PNB and UBI; 2/ Building executive sponsorship for Cloud adoption: by engaging CIOs and Executive Directors (EDs 444 are function heads who report into MDs) to build mindshare drive specific call-to-actions of identifying the first set of workloads to 445 be migrated 3/ Joint account planning with key ISVs: Work on joint account planning with key strategic ISVs such as CRMNext, SFDC, 446 Nucleus, Lentra, Newgen, Finacle, Mindgate, TCS Bancs, Workapps, etc. E.g.: This has helped us identify opportunities in SBI, PNB, 447 Canara, etc. with two key wins (with CRMNext at PNB, $3M/5yr; and SFDC at Canara Bank) 4/ Align with incumbent and challenger 448 GSIs/Large SI partners (atleast 2 per account): All PSBs have major GSIs as their outsourcing partners. PSBs typically award end-to-449 end RFPs for specific applications/initiatives on a turnkey basis for 5/ 7 years including implementation and managed services to an 450 SI/GSIs. Early alignment will help us engage/identify early Pre-RFP stage opportunities. 6/ Skilling and enablement: Given their low 451 Cloud awareness levels, we will work to drive both broad based and executive skilling and enablement initiatives across these 452 accounts including leveraging marketing (ABM). 7/ Focus on Banking Subsidiaries for In-year growth: PSBs have Insurance, cards, 453 securities, NBFC or wealth mgmt. subsidiaries who generally have more autonomy in decision making (relative to the Parent Bank) 454 due to their governance structure and smaller size. Some subsidiaries such as Canara HSBC, SBI GIC, etc. have already started on 455 Cloud/AWS with key applications, giving us an opportunity to accelerate them in 2024. Tactically, the above key initiatives will be 456 captured in an account plan collaborating with extended teams to drive our alignment and focus. We will also engage external 457 influencers and bodies such as IBA (Indian Banking Association, which is dominated by PSB members) to drive thought leadership 458 (E.g.: participating in industry events such as IBA Awards & pursue joint publishing of whitepapers) or one-to-many 459 initiatives/workshops on Cloud transformation. The key sales plays will include: a/ ISV aligned sales play; b/ Data platforms, 460 regulatory reporting & ML; c/ Security and threat intelligence solutions to engage CISO offices; d/ VMCA, as a point of entry for 461 T&D, peripheral workloads (replicate the win with UBI, $650K ARR) e/ Digital Banking (a big investment area for PSBs as they try to 462 raise their digital customer experiences to become on-par with Private Banks); f/ Co-lending and Agri lending solutions play: PSBs 463 have a lion’s share of Agri & ‘priority sector’ lending market India. We believe, our increased investments into PSBs from 2024 464 coupled with the specific strategies listed about should set us on path to unlock their potential and drive accelerated growth to 10X 465 to an est. ~27.5M ARR by FY27 (from <$2.3M in2023). 466 JAN 2024 | FY23 OP2 – FSI

For the Focus cohort of accounts, 474 marketing will focus on mapping industry and LoB use cases, identify 1P + 3P solutions to address them, and curate localized GTM 475 activities. Our effort is to prioritize FSI deep accounts and high value Fintech/ Enterprise Focus accounts by a) Driving a retention 476 play with Top 20 customers (69% of segment revenue) with curated interventions like ABM in account events, FSI dedicated track 477 in Summit, FSI only ExecLeaders, bigger participation in the Fintech forum, higher representation at re:Invent and EBC roaster. b) 478 Building growth plays for Next 43 accounts (Focus Select, 19% of FSI revenue) through India properties like FSI Conclave (25+ CXOs 479 and 250+ITDM audience), Customer events like Razorpay FTX, industry association/Analyst events (Gartner/IBA/ IDC), CxO Forum 480 engagements in partnership with ISV (Lentra) and community led engagements like FSI Tech Leaders Assembly (ITDMs focused). c) 481 Driving Scale Enablement Motions for Focus core will happen primarily via digital properties i.e. APJ led digital programs like 482 innovate, webinars, virtual account workshops and selective 3rd party industry events like IDG100, ET BFSI forum, CNBC Gen AI 483 forum. We will also accelerate our efforts on building brand plays with leading publishers especially for FSI. We have to scale our 484 FSI References by >2X. While we have had 10+ referenceable assets created in the last 12 months (HDFC Life/Axis Bank), we need 485 to double down on case studies as FSI customers take longer to approve case studies/ PTI articles. We did 5 written FSI case studies 486 in last 12 months (Freecharge, Paytm, Setu)  and have  additional 3 case studies in progress( SBI Life, Max Life & HDFC) 487 Appendix 8: Cross-service PPA in Fintech 488 Account Name Term Length Deal Expiration Date  TCV Paytm Mobile Solutions Pvt.

It operates in 50+ countries worldwide with an FY22-23 annual revenue of $25B (17% YoY Growth), PAT of 5.7% (21% YoY Growth), $50B order book and market capitalization of $56B. It is one of Asia’s largest vertically integrated Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) companies, and is a market leader in turnkey projects. The Company's manufacturing footprint extends across eight countries in addition to India.  L&T as the promoter holds 66% stake in L&T Finance (FY22-23 annual revenue of $1.5B), 69% stake in LTIMindtree (FY22-23 annual revenue of $4B) and 74% stake in LTTS (FY22-23 annual Revenue of $1 B) - the 3 other listed entities of L&T Group as on date. L&T broadly has 7 business verticals - Infrastructure projects, Hi-Tech manufacturing, Energy Projects, IT Services, Financial Services, Development projects and Realty. Infrastructure (EPC) segment contributes ~45% to consolidated revenue followed by services (~30%). ‘Lakshya’, the Group’s 5-year strategic plan was formulated and approved by the Board in FY 2021-22. Lakshya 2026 plans to achieve a) value-accretive growth of their current businesses - EPC Projects (Energy & Infrastructure) and Hi-Tech Manufacturing (Heavy Engineering, Defence, Electrolyzers, and Battery Energy Storage Systems), b) reducing/exiting noncore businesses, c) developing innovative business offerings catering to ride the energy transition wave, d) scaling up digital and e-commerce businesses (L&T Edutech, L&T Sufin and L&T Cloudfiniti) and e) business sustainability through sharper focus on ESG (committed to water and Carbon Neutrality by 2035 and 2040 respectively) and shareholder value creation (ROE of 18%+ by FY25-26).  L&T has a long-standing relationship with Microsoft with regular executive connects with Satya Nadella. L&T has been leveraging Microsoft as their primary CSP (Microsoft EA at ~10M+ ARR). Microsoft also maintain a 360-degree relationship with L&T providing reciprocal business to their IT companies: LTIMindtree & LTTS (Microsoft is erstwhile Mindtree’s largest customer; estimated $150M ARR). GCP is the incumbent vendor at L&T Finance.    2.1 Customer Strategic Priorities   L&T Group aims to generate a revenue of $32.9 Billion by March 2026 (17% growth in FY22-23). Lakshya 2026 plans to achieve value-accretive growth in the existing businesses through a multi-pronged approach of targeting opportunities arising out of global trends, with a focus on ESG and Sustainability. The underlying emphasis of Lakshya 2026 is to ride the momentum in existing and emerging technology trends for IT services, reorganise the business offerings to serve the customers better and drive profitability through operational excellence, value engineering and digitalisation initiatives.  [Adoption of Digital]: Use of AI, IoT and cloud computing to enhance customer experience and differentiate in a volatile market. Invest in high-growth areas such as data centers, cloud, AI, cybersecurity, and blockchain to add to existing capabilities and offerings.  L&T Cloudfiniti is aimed at offering cutting edge technology solutions through the state-of-the-art data centers and cloud infrastructure. [Growth of new ventures]: Drive growth by capitalizing on opportunities for new businesses like Green Energy (EPC), Data Centers, EduTech (Learning and Assessment platform), B2B e-commerce platform Su-Fin serving MSMEs in construction and industrial products. This priority is driven by SNS and key executives at L&T Construction and L&T Edutech  [Grow their IT services businesses]:  - L&T plans to grow its IT Services business (LTIMindtree, LTTS) to 50% of group revenue over the next 5 years (currently 27%).   [Divesting non-core businesses/assets]: In the past, L&T had made significant investments in concession projects such as metro rail (Hyderabad Metro), road operations and tolling (through L&T Infrastructure Development Projects Limited) and power (Nabha Power). However, the focus in recent years has been on reducing its exposure to such public-private partnerships (PPPs) through divestment. Edelweiss Alternatives has acquired 100% equity stake in L&T Infrastructure Development Projects Limited (L&T IDPL) from existing shareholders - L&T and CPP Investments in FY22-23. 3.0 AWS Strategy & Goals   Overall health status for the account and why   L&T Group (outside of LTIMindtree and LTTS which is managed by our ITS team) is an Early- Stage Greenfield account for us - the AWS revenue in 2023 from L&T Group was less than $75K ARR (largely PoCs – e2Log, Attendance Management System, Code Editor, LMS at Eductech, etc and storage/backup workloads at L&T Finance). To summarize, we do not have any L&T Group workload in production on AWS at the moment.  Over the years, this account has been a tough nut for us to crack given the clout and 360-degree relationship that Microsoft has in this account for more than a decade along with an Enterprise Agreement covering Office 365, Windows, SQL & Azure (Total Microsoft EA is ~$10M-$12M ARR). Some of the deals that we have contested and lost in the last couple of years include the Smart Manufacturing RFP At L&T Heavy Engineering, e2Log Middleware, LMS for Edutech, SuFin b2b platform etc.   In this year, we are working on both a scale (mapping entities like L&T Finance, L&T Realty, L&T Power, L&T Defense along with various key stakeholders at the Corp IT Team) with as well as depth motion (deepening existing relationships with L&T Construction, L&T Hydrocarbon, L&T Edutech and L&T Heavy Engineering) in this account. Though there is a lot of resistance to change, there is a possibility for the customer to look at a multi -cloud environment, provided we stay invested in our approach and endeavor to make them successful. In our engagement in the account in the last 4 weeks, we have unearthed 2 new significant opportunities – RISE with SAP for L&T Group across all their 15 instances ($1M ARR) and GCP/DC migration at L&T Finance (MAP 2.0)   We will have to build on the LT meetings we have had in the past - with the CEO and MD of L&T - SN Subrahmanyan (with Adam Selipsky, Puneet, Vaishali, Raghu), R Ganesan (Head of L&T Construction), Mahesh Chikodi (CDO) to earn trust and gain mindshare in this account. At a user level, we have to focus on and invest in AWS training and certification for the L&T teams across their various entities. We have to build AWS champions both at a leadership/business stakeholder level as well as user level in this account.   Our Partner strategy has been mostly for driving/accelerating PoCs - we need to create a partner eco-system which can create as well as drive multiple opportunities. We also need to have a joint GTM with LTIMindtree to create a plan for L&T group.   3.1 AWS Goals for the account   Ambition: L&T Group becoming a $1M Run rate account for AWS by 2026   [Goal #1] Getting our first production workload at L&T Group by H1 of FY24  [Goal #2] Get a foot at the door to contest all strategic opportunities in this account. Establish AWS as a partner of choice for all digital transformations, migration and modernization projects across L&T in FY24.   [Goal#3] Lead and win with AWS Industrial Sales plays 1/Industrial IOT & Digital Twin 2/Connected factories 3/Supply Chain 4/Quality 5/Worker Safety etc. along with industry specialists, BDSI, ProServe and partners   [Goal #4] Sign up at least one L&T case study in FY24 which will help in L&T being a reference customer externally and internally at L&T group.   [Goal #5] Plan an EBC and work on COI/DI workshops for the LT at L&T   [Goal #6] Explore One Amazon/Cross Amazon opportunities   3.2 Think Big Ideas  [TB 1 - Promote a culture of innovation and build AWS champions in the account]: L&T’s workforce across their core infrastructure and manufacturing entities are not trained to think, innovate and adopt digital as fast as the other companies in the similar space are moving. They are also dependent on partners to help them scale on cloud. To lead with COI, DI, WB workshops, Prototyping/Modax/Devax engagements to earn trust and build mindshare at the CXO level. At a user level, we need to invest in our relationship with L&T by offering complimentary trainings that can lead to certified AWS resources who can be our champions in the account.  [TB 2 – Explore and drive a Pan-Amazon relationship]: We need to explore Pan-Amazon opportunities (AWS T&C - L&T Edutech joint GTM/collaboration opportunities Amazon Pay-L&T Finance 2P/3P relationship for underwriting loans, LTTS for silicon/R&D, leasing land from L&T for our DCs, etc) leading to a larger relationship with L&T Group.   3.3 Technical Account Plan & Specialized Services Theme 3.3.1 Technical Account Plan  L&T Group has a centralized as well decentralized decision-making structure. While policies are defined centrally, initiatives are driven at an individual company level. If the individual companies decide to build instead of buy, their choice is always LTIMindtree and more often than not LTIMindtree leads with a Microsoft stack - we have to work with our partner team to educate the teams at LTIMindtree at newer app build out practices through an AppMod/ModAx workshop. Also, most of the entities at L&T including Construction, Hydrocarbon, Power, Corp IT have Azure ExpressRoute already set up. The following sections discusses the overall technology landscape, strategic technology initiatives & key workloads which SA teams will focus on to drive AWS adoption within the L&T Group.  3.3.1.1 Existing Technology Landscape ERP – EIP (in-house) at L&T Construction, Infor at L&T Heavy Engineering and L&T Defence, Rest of the Group is on SAP - 15 instances of SAP (S/4HANA and ECC) 3.3.1.2 Rapid pace of digital transformation  Under the direction of the Chairman, we see an increasingly aggressive adoption of technologies to drive L&T digital journey. Being present in these accounts at the right time and repeatedly demonstrating our value-proposition will help us grow our mind share and pivot ourselves in a long-term strategic relationship over the next 2-3 years.  3.3.1.2 Key Tech initiatives:  The L&T SA POD would be driving the following technology initiatives. 1/Migration of Key Workloads 2/DC Exit 3/Security Assessments 4/Adoption of AWS  The identified initiatives stem from the concerns highlighted by the customers, issues encountered in ’23 as well as global AWS campaigns to adopt the latest AWS Regions / Services.  3.3.1.3 What’s working well:  1/ Over the past 4 weeks, we have had in-person meetings with the CXOs at all the 6 entities of L&T (listed in SFDC) along with the Group CDO - SAP Practice Head at L&T Corp; GM-IT at L&T IDPL; CDO, CTO and Head – IT Infra at L&T Finance; CDO, GM-IT, Digital Transformation leads at L&T Realty; GM-IT at L&T Construction, GM-Projects at L&T Hydrocarbon and Head-IT at L&T Power and initiated newer engagements as well as checking if we can get a window of opportunity to revisit and get engaged in some of the deals that we lost last year (Middleware for e2Log, HEIC RFP for Smart Manufacturing, etc)  2/Enablement Sessions (SA) – We have started with enablement sessions done for the L&T Construction team around OU creation best practices, website hosting, greenfield security controls and FSX file sharing. Post meeting with the Corp-IT team at L&T, we are working with our GenAI specialist team to conduct a half-day GenAI workshop for the Corp IT team at L&T. The detailed agenda for the workshop has been shared, awaiting confirmation reg the dates.   3.3.1.4 What’s not working:   Preference for L&T Cloudfiniti: The teams at L&T Power and Heavy Engineering have mentioned that that they are under a lot of pressure to move some of their existing workloads to L&T Cloufiniti. This is bound to go up for pure play IaaS workloads.   Pricing Comparison with Azure: While some group companies show interest in moving to AWS the deep discounts offered by Azure for existing workloads create a resistance for customer to adopt AWS. We have had at least 4 instances in FY23 where our pricing was on the higher side compared to Azure.  Retention of On-prem HW: Some of the entities have decided to retain the on-premise hardware as mandated by the Executive team. This happened for L&T HEIC opportunity after their review meeting with SNS where they were asked to retain the on-premises hardware and only take up cloud services for the new use cases or where infrastructure is not available on-premises.  3.3.2 Key Must Win Initiatives   1/ RISE with SAP for L&T Group: ($1M ARR) RISE with SAP opportunity at L&T Group for 15 instances – identified 3 weeks ago when we were presenting our PoV to the L&T Realty team – have met the Corp IT team and presented our key RISE with SAP differentiators to the SAP Practice Head and his team at L&T post this meeting. Next steps include a joint meeting with the SAP team in Feb to present our overall proposition.  2/ GCP/DC Migration at L&T Finance (MAP 2.0): We have initiated an overall migration conversation with L&T Finance (GCP incumbent) when we met their CDO, CTO and Head – IT Infra to present our NBFC PoV. Our follow-on meeting with the customer is scheduled for 20th Feb along with our Migrations team where we will be presenting a migration roadmap for them. The customer has shared their existing asset details – 1200+ VMs with 800+ VMs on GCP at the moment. 3.4 Priorities to Drive Execution  3.4.1 Priorities for Short Term (90 Days)  1/ AWS Training and Certification: We need to invest in our relationship with L&T by conducting complimentary Architecting on AWS (3-day hands on workshops) for the L&T teams in Chennai and Mumbai – we will get 25+ participants in each of these cities. This has be done once every quarter in this year. This will help us to drive up the no of AWS certified resources at L&T (non-existent currently compared to Azure which has 10+ certified people at Edutech, 5+ at Construction, 5+ at the Corp IT team, etc) with the possibility of converting a few of them as AWS champions in the account in the future.   2/ Landing Zone: Multiple entities at L&T including Construction, Hydrocarbon, Power, Corp IT have Azure ExpressRoute already set up. Ask: We need to invest in a Landing Zone setup for L&T through involvement of our ProServe team if required.  3/ Partner Strategy: Post our meeting with the current partner in this account (Pentagon) we realized that their role was limited to PoC acceleration/delivery. We laid out our expectations clearly to them in terms of they having more skin in the game post which they have designated an AM for L&T. Also, L&T Group’s preference for Build projects is LTIMindtree who tends to lead with a MS platform (case in point is the Attendance Management System for L&T Construction) – we have to work with our partner team to educate the teams at LTIMindtree at newer app build out practices through an AppMod/ModAx workshop. We need to work on the ISV mapping for L&T Group and also onboard regional partners who can help us create and drive new opportunities across L&T Group.  4/ Industry Mapping and positioning: Accelerate leading with our Industrial solutions a) Digital Twin b) Connected Assets and IoT c) Quality improvement d) AI/ML e) Energy Management/Sustainability to help improve efficiency, provide deeper insights, reduce project costs and improve margins.  3.4.2 Priorities for Medium to Long term (> 90 days)  1/Leverage Amazon EBC, COI, LFA, DI workshops: Lead with EBC, COI and WB workshops to build trust and earn mindshare at the CXO level across group entities  2/Industry Forums and events: Leverage Industry forums and round tables/executive meets to gain mindshare in the constructions/EPC industry in India where L&T has the biggest play. We need Marketing team’s proactively support identify at least one such event where we can secure a speaker slot in FY23. We also need help from our BDs to share information on any such global events where we can invite L&T  3/Mapping ISV partners across L&T Group: L&T uses ISV solutions extensively across their group entities. We will have to identify the current ISV eco system at L&T Group and its current deployment (possible migration opportunity if on Azure) b) Create GTM with new ISVs who can help build up industry solutions eg: Proserve along with support from Industry BD’s , ISV and partner teams.   3.5 Three Year AWS Revenue Goal  <<To be completed later>>  USD m 2024 Forecast 2025 Projection 2026 Projection ARR current Utility workloads 0 0.00 0.00 ARR from won/launched projects 0   ARR from Qualified+ pipe launches 0   ARR Gap (Opps to be Qualified) 0   Projected Utility Revenue 0.00 0.00 0.00 Proserve    Support    Training    -/- EDP Discount    -/- Credits    Other    Amortized Sales Revenue 0.00 0.00 0.00 % Y/Y        3.5.1 Commercial Considerations  Private Pricing: L&T Group currently does not have any PPA including LTIMindtree and L&T Technology Services. While we had initiated a discussion, they were hesitant to commit, reasons given as the uncertainty coming out of Covid and the merger of LTI and Mindtree. We will re-initiate this conversation in FY24.  3.6 Leadership Asks  4.0 Executive Engagement  [Priority 1 - Invite and plan a EBC and COI for L&T Group]: Plan at least one EBC and one Culture of Innovation workshop for key executives of L&T group in FY 2023. Basis the feedback, we can expand this across the group.  [Priority 2 - Plan a half yearly connect with MD of L&T Group]: L&T Group CEO is a key stakeholder in driving the larger L&T group strategies and decisions. We plan to fix a connect every 6 months to drive a better mindshare and a strategic engagement. 4.1 Executive Stakeholder Map  Executive Stakeholder Map is available in Appendix 1  5.0 Cross-Functional Plans 5.1 Partner  Till now, we have been working with partners for PoC delivery/acceleration - Pentagon for PoCs at L&T Construction, Ganit for AI/ML use cases, IBM for Weld Quality inspection, Flentas for LMS PoC at L&T Edutech, etc.   LTIMindtree will continue to play a bigger role within the group by working on larger transformational projects (like RISE with SAP) and new app build outs (like attendance management system). LTIMindtree’s preferred app stack tends to be on Microsoft – we need to work on a larger GTM with them specific to L&T Group. We do see PwC as the BCAP being active. We need to work towards identifying the various ISV partners who are active across the L&T group so that we proactively engage with them. Also, we need to identify regional partners who will help us create as well as drive new opportunities with L&T Group. 5.2 ProServe   Need to work with ProServe on Complimentary workshops (discovery, data modernization, etc), Landing zone set up and accelerating qualified Gen AI use cases.  5.3 Training & Certification   We need to invest in our relationship with L&T by conducting complimentary Architecting on AWS (3-day hands on workshops) for the L&T teams in Chennai and Mumbai – we will get 25+ participants in each of these cities. This has be done once every quarter in this year. This will help us to drive up the no of AWS certified resources at L&T (non-existent currently compared to Azure which has 10+ certified people at Edutech, 5+ at Construction, 5+ at the Corp IT team, etc) with the possibility of converting a few of them as AWS champions in the account in the future.   Explore the possibility of a joint GTM/tie up with L&T Edutech. 5.4 WWSO/Specialist org  IoT: We will work and widen our scope further with the current opportunities like Connected Machines, Digital Twin, Quality Inspection, worker safety. For account like L&T Heavy engineering, we will go with our full stack of IoT services while it will get integrated with the partner LTIMindtree’s offerings. We will drive the same sales plays in other greenfield accounts to enable faster digital transformation. We have to explore possible solutions for Supply chain/Material management for EPC industry MS Windows: MODERNIZATION: We will have to work with L&T to explore modernization of their windows and SQL based applications to reduce dependency on MS. We can offer to modernize a small subset of shortlisted windows-based applications. Based on the output, we can build a 3- or 5-year modernization roadmap to deliver operational efficiency, time to market, performance improvements, developer productivity, lower TCO. Co-invest in a modernization lab to deliver pilots for individual group companies to showcase business value of modernizing into cloud-native services.  MIGRATION: Establish Microsoft license optimization on-premise (EA outflows) and on the cloud (BYOL) as a key agenda with the Group Procurement Officer. Leverage AWS DC Divest program to accelerate cloud adoption. Help cloud adoption "laggards" with a simple path to the cloud through VMCA to showcase benefits of TCO optimization and easy migration. AI/ML: We will work towards 1/ Taking our AI/ML services across sales plays like Sagemaker (MLOps and LCNC), Intelligent Document Processing and Intelligent Search across L&T Group with ‘Art of possible’ session 2/One Data focus campaigns on use cases which spans across multiple service lines e.g. Predictive Maintenance in MFG using ML +ANA+ IoT 3/ Explore opportunities for Monitron led reliability maintenance, and run pilot with select group entities 4/Identify partners who can deliver use cases in the EPC industry 5/ML with Digital Innovation in which we would want to align ML use cases with an objective to enable customers to build an MVP on their selected AIML use case 5.5 BD/Growth programs   5.6 Functional teams  Marketing: We will seek support from Marketing to identify one event/executive round table for the constructions and EPC Industry and secure a speaker slot. Apart from this we will target events/sessions based on the executives/persona eg: CIO/CDO and Business vertical specific events eg: Global EPC Contract & Project Management Summit.

In Progress Diversification Green Top Partners (GSI/ ISVs/ BCAPs etc) BlazeClan, PwC, BMCSL/Crayon, Kyndryl, IBM, Cloud2scale, Ganit (in active engagements) Resourcing D&AI Specialist SA for driving focused groupwide initiatives  1.0 Executive Summary 3 Aditya Birla Group (ABG)  is a 150 year old global conglomerate, part of Fortune 500 with 140K employees and a revenue of $60B. 4 ABG is present across various businesses such as 1/Manufacturing with 130 + plants under listed companies: Hindalco (Aluminum, 5 Copper), Grasim (Yarn, Pulp & Fiber, Textiles, Chemicals, Insulators, Paints, B2B E-Comm), Ultratech (Cement), Birla Carbon (Carbon 6 Black) 2/Financial Services listed under: Aditya Birla Capital (‘ABC’) holding the Life & Health Insurance, Lending, PMS, 7 Wealth/Pension Mgmt, AB AMC (Mutual Funds, Portfolio Management, Wealth) and Svatantra Microfinance 3/Fashion Retail under 8 AB Fashion Retail (ABFRL), house of brands (TMRW) 4/ Trading under Swiss Singapore (SSOE)  5) Contract Mining (Essel Mining) 6) 9 Renewable energy under Grasim.  10    11 ABG has defined a multi-cloud strategy with AWS being present in more entities compared to other CSPs. With the partnership 12 starting from 2018, the account generated FY23 revenue of $5.6M with largest contributions from ABFRL($1.8M) and ABC($2M).  13 We signed 2 MAPs at Aditya Birla Capital subsidiaries in 2022-23 i.e. AB Housing Finance ($0.8M), AB Sunlife Insurance ($0.65M). Key 14 workloads running on AWS are E-Commerce and Super App for ABFRL; SAP for Chemicals, Textiles, Essel Mining, SSOE etc. along 15 with applications like core lending, underwriting, payment gateways, DMS in ABC Financial Entities. AWS also hosts group level 16 platforms for ABG such as IOT, Logistics (Miles), Analytics (Nucleus 2.0). Almost all entities run websites on AWS.  17  18 Our vision is to be recognized as a “strategic partner” and grow our revenue to $14M by 2026 ($5.6M in FY23) by focusing on a 19 differentiated strategy for the entities and group level. 1/Financial Services: AB Capital (ABC) is the most advanced in cloud 20 adoption with AWS being the preferred Cloud Provider in these subsidiaries: AB Housing Finance, AB Finance and AB Sunlife. Azure is 21 the preferred Cloud Provider in AB Health Insurance, though they are thinking of migrating back to on-premise given the huge 22 expenditure on Azure. We will continue to focus on accelerating ABC’s cloud journey with Migration, Modernization and Data 23 Strategy. We have already had a COI Session with ABC Chairman and executive leadership of subsidiaries and working closely to set 24 up new entity called ‘One ABC’ focusing on customer acquisition for various subsidiaries through digital channels. The existing 25 entities will focus on customer Service and operations from a customer journey perspective using digital innovation 2. Fashion 26 Retail: ABFRL is relatively advanced in Cloud journey with Azure and AWS having equal mindshare. Our focus is to gain wallet share 27 by bringing more value in e-commerce/customer facing apps where AWS is present through security, architecture reviews, 28 modernization and cost optimization. We shall also focus on white spaces around Supply Chain and Smart Factory initiatives and 29 build executive mindshare using COI, EV to identify newer areas to partner including One Amazon. 3/Manufacturing: This includes 30 multiple entities that are in different stages of maturity in their cloud journey. We will focus on migration opportunities and 31 establish key lighthouse wins around smart manufacturing, supply chain, e-commerce, SAP modernization and analytics. This 32 developmental work is expected to generate significant revenue from Yr 2. 4/Group Level Initiatives: We will continue to enhance 33 Page 2 of 23  mindshare at the group level by supporting them on existing group level platforms on IIOT, Sustainability and Logistics. We will work 34 closely with the Group Data and Analytics Team to build newer platforms, use-cases around data lakes and the Group IT & BMCSL 35 team to help them scale ABG Cloud Konect and thereby generate increased share amongst all cloud providers that BMCSL offers. 36  37 We plan to execute on these identified opportunities: 1/DC Exit for ABFRL ($0.75M), 2/ Data warehousing wins/Teradata exit at 38 ABSLI($0.25M),DW on AWS ($0.1M) 3/S4H to Cloud at Ultratech ($1.2M),  S4H at Birla Carbon ($0.4M) 4/Scaling AWS adoption in 39 incubated entities like TMRW (entity created for acquiring and growing 30 new brands in D2C mode), Birla Pivot One ABC etc 5/Fast 40 track modernization initiatives at Svatantra microfinance and their integration with acquired entity Chaitanya Microfinance($0.5M 41 ARR & a MAP potential) 6/DR initiatives at ABFL 7/Umbrella MAP with BMCSL ($0.5M) 8/key GenAI initiatives at ABC($0.2M/ARR), 42 working with domain specific solution providers like Pints.ai. We intend to sign at least two 1.5 Mn PPA in next 2 years with ABFRL 43 and ABC as well as explore a Grp Level PPA construct.  44  45 2.0 Customer Overview 46 The ABG businesses have grown into global powerhouses across a wide range of sectors such as Aluminum & Copper, Pulp and 47 Fiber, Chemicals, Textiles (fiber, fabric, yarn), Carbon Black, Telecom, Cement, Financial Services, Fashion Retail and Renewable 48 Energy. A) Manufacturing businesses have built significant scale advantages and will continue investing in capex significantly till 49 FY27 to ensure this advantage. We see strong focus on digitalization of operations and sustainability as they are large scale emitters 50 (Aluminum, Copper, Cement, Chemicals, Pulp & Fiber etc). Adani’s entry into Cement has increased the need for Ultratech to ramp 51 up their scale of operations. They also intend to digitize Manufacturing process from the Mine to Bagging part of cement production. 52 B) Retail wing ABFRL faces the challenge of  rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences and buying behavior as well 53 as supply chain issues. Almost all the businesses are looking at Supply Chain Modernization as Global Supply chain disruption has 54 forced them to look at better planning and material substitution. They are expanding into adjacencies with consumer focus: Paints, 55 Jewelry, B2B E-Commerce for Building Material (MSME) TMRW (D2C Retail), Jewelry etc C) Financial services - They are creating an 56 entity called ‘One ABC’ for digitally onboarding and cross selling for all ABC entities and managing large partners. Financial Services 57 businesses continue to focus on increasing their retail business share and acquiring customers at speed and scale. D) ABG has a 58 federated structure with each entity making its own decisions. However, in an effort to better influence the process, the central IT 59 team has started positioning Birla Management Consultancy Services Ltd (BMCSL) as an entity that will centrally procure, manage 60 and govern various cloud services under ABG Cloud Konect Program. The 5 pillars of this program are: 1/Integration with On Premise 61 Systems, 2/Cloud Secure gateway, 3/Partnerships with AWS, Azure, OCI, GCP (Ongoing). 4/Governance Risk and Compliance. BMCSL 62 has onboarded workloads from few group entities to ABG Cloud Konect on AWS, Azure and is looking to expand.  63  64 Corporate IT advocates a Multi-Cloud approach with entities have independent commercial teams that are price sensitive; most 65 partners quote all CSPs; thus making it an extremely competitive account. There is significant competition from MSFT who leverage 66 groupwide EA Agreement benefits for Azure along with MSFT Dynamics, PowerApps, PowerBI to create additional analytics pull. 67 They also use Azure Hybrid Benefits and licensing leverage to create barriers for change. Although most entities view AWS positively, 68 some entities are inclined in varying degrees towards MSFT due to their existing investments in Azure like 1/Health Insurance (high 69 inclination) due to Core Insurance on Azure 2/ABFRL (low tilt) due to Omnichannel/Storefront/POS/CRM on Azure. Birla Carbon CIO 70 is inclined towards Azure given her past experience of Azure based transformation. Hindalco has strong Oracle stack presence and 71 MSFT India MD Anant Maheshwari on its board. GCP is trying to gain entry into ABG  through BMCSL using a lower pricing strategy.  72 2.1 Customer Strategic Priorities  73 [Increase Customer Focus] Acquiring, owning and engaging customers in 1/ Existing B2C Segments i.e. Financial and Fashion 74 businesses including D2C (TMRW house of brands) 2/New Ventures in adjacent spaces like Building Material(Birla Pivot), Jewelry etc. 75 3/ B2B segments by personalizing solutions for customers across the overall value chain by utilizing the ABG network effect i.e. using 76 Grasim B2B e-commerce to digitally cross-sell solutions to dealers across all ABG subsidiaries and leverage customer analytics for 77 targeted marketing For e.g. position financial solutions from ABC to existing cement dealers.    78  79 [Improve capacity utilization & Sustainability] With thin margins and need of improved capacity utilization, Manufacturing business 80 is looking at all avenues for improving productivity leveraging technology levers. There is a clear direction to focus on sustainability 81 as most manufacturing businesses have significant carbon footprint. ABG wants to mitigate operational environmental risks by 82 undertaking projects on energy conservation, becoming energy efficient, and changing fuel mix through use of renewables and 83 waste heat recovery.  84  85 [Leverage Group Synergy] ABG wants to establish BMCSL as a central entity with standardized security and guardrails, landing zone 86 for multi-cloud adoption across various business entities to drive better economies of scale via  price contracts at group Level as well 87 as competitive bidding. However, large ABG entities do not have a mandate to work or accept recommendations of BMCSL. There is 88 Page 3 of 23  also focus on building and scaling groupwide platforms being developed by Corp. IT + Group Data & Analytics like ABG IIOT Cloud, 89 Supply Chain & Logistics, HR Analytics etc. for businesses thereby reducing the cost of experimentation and time to market.    90  91 3.0 AWS Strategy & Goals  92 ABG has grown XX% YoY with revenue of $5.6M in FY23 with 2 MAP 2.0 contracts at Housing Finance and Life Insurance signed over 93 FY22-23.  94  95 • AB Capital (ABC): We intend to continue migration momentum and move Aditya Birla Finance onto MAP 2.0. We have 96 conducted COI session with Leadership of all Financial entities to help them quickly ramp up One ABC through Data strategy and 97 digital capabilities. In parallel we will continue to help them build and sustain an Innovation Hub at ABC level and drive 98 Modernization projects to move away from monolithic to microservices based architecture, Licensing and increase Resiliency.  99 • ABFRL: We will continue to focus on DC exit (40 applications), scaling E-Commerce, SuperApp, D2C growth(TMRW house of 100 brands) and work on Supply Chain initiatives including Planning and Smart Factory around Workforce visibility. While Analytics is 101 on Teradata, Databricks on Azure and PowerBI, we will focus on specific analytics around E-Commerce and SuperApp as well as 102 Planning. We have started discussions for a COI session with Senior Leadership and CTO has suggested we wait for next 103 Financial Year to initiate this. 104 • Manufacturing entities: Our focus will be to set up Light House Wins in Smart Manufacturing, IDF and Supply Chain Planning like 105 Pulp Planning Control `Tower, Mining Soln., Logistics Control Tower and increased momentum around SAP on Cloud as well as 106 Analytics. We shall continue engaging around ESG and Sustainability as this is a developing area with focus. Working with key 107 industry partners with ready solutions to cut short of the adoption cycle. 108 • At a group level we plan to enable BMCSL through partner programs and technical skilling to secure larger mindshare to partner 109 for Group Level App Migration like Peoplesoft Group HR and existing DR exits. We will continue to focus on Group Data 110 Analytics team to increase further capabilities and adoption of Demand forecasting, Analytics platforms and explore newer 111 areas of GenAI mindshare.  112 3.1 AWS Goals for the account  113  114 Ambition: Grow ABG to be a $15M account by end of 2026 and establish at least 1 Pan Amazon partnership with an ABG entity by 115 2025 and overall 3 entities by 2026. 116  117 [Goal 1: Grow footprint in Finance and Retail] Establish AWS as the partner of choice with largest wallet share in both Finance and 118 Retail with an annualized  revenue of $5M ARR in each entity by FY26 including Analytics and AI/ML Revenue of $0.6M each.  119 [Goal 2: PPA closures] Sign 1 PPA for $1.5M by FY24 with AB Fashion Retail or AB Capital. Generate sufficient AWS workload and 120 mindshare with BMCSL for PPA of $1.5M aligning to group goal of making BMCSL lead cloud provider by FY25.  121 [Goal 3: Vertical specific solutions] Secure 2-3 lighthouse wins across. in Manufacturing across: 1/Connected factories & IDF 122 2/Supply Chain leading to Analytics. Generate IOT related AWS consumption of $200K ARR in FY24 including Influenced Revenue. 123 3/Mining Automation Solution having daily shift based planning based on resource availability and Quality grades 124 [Goal 4: Grow Data & AI  pipeline] Win mindshare and wallet share for AWS native analytics stack, including GenAI opportunities at 125 ABC. Focus on working on a extended reach mechanism through Group Data & Analytics (GDNA) on forecasting, data pipeline etc 126 3.2 Think Big Ideas 127 [TB 1] AWS being cloud partner of choice at Financial and Retail entities resulting in $5M+/3Y PPA by FY25  128 1/Financial entities: ABC is focused on developing innovative ways of engaging their customers in a digital  first way (External 129 Customers, Internal) and sustain the culture of innovation that will help them grow their retail initiative and improve customer 130 acquisition and service experience. We have done the COI session with Chairman and Exec Leadership and are planning to conduct  131 Working Backwards on One ABC Data Strategy along with sharing of customer proof points/references of AWS Services and 132 architectural guidance. We will continue to execute on digitization projects.  The account team will work with AWS Banking BD, FSI-133 ISV BD and GSI Partner Managers to focus on core application modernization/migration of applications like Distribution Platform, 134 Loan Management Platform, Cross Sell  etc. We will need Proserv funding of 100K and Prototyping team to build complex use cases 135 that might come up as we progress on the engagement. Partner engagements will be needed to help re-platform some of the 136 existing ISV Solns. to open platforms and databases.  137 2/ Retail: We will engage at senior leadership level at Retail to establish One Amazon partnership as well as conduct COI, Working 138 Backwards,  sessions in Supply Chain and Smart Factory related areas. We will conduct Security reviews and set up 3 Year Security 139 and Interoperability Roadmap through adoption of Modernization and API Gateways. We will also focus on publishing big wins with 140 the help of logistical support from marketing on tech workshops/LFA/gamedays or AWS innovation sessions. With the focus on their 141 Page 4 of 23  D2C initiatives like TMRW, we want to partner with ABFRL for improving their supply chain operations through one Amazon 142 experience sharing. 143   144 [TB 2] AWS being Partner of Choice for Smart Manufacturing, Supply Chain and Sustainability initiatives across Mfg entities 145 ($1.5M ARR over 2 years) We will achieve this by partnering with players such as Cognite, Aspen Tech, Siemens, Bosch, Palantir, 146 Infor, Anaplan etc. We will work with marketing to 1/Build Industry visibility by aligning ourselves to industry conversations as well 147 as selectively sponsoring 3rd party manufacturing industry events, round tables and industry thought leadership events.  2/ Extend 148 ABG CxO’s an invitation to present and speak at relevant events like India Industry vertical symposium. 3/Nominate one ABG group 149 company for AWS supply chain platform pilots and thereafter scale. We will need IOT, Supply Chain BD as well as connects with IOT 150 and Manufacturing Executive Leadership of AWS alongwith Proserv to help build some complex use cases. We shall continue to 151 engage with entities around solutions like Mining, Logistics, E-Commerce, Data Lake, Planning related Control Tower and extend 152 leadership connects as much as possible through these conversations. In terms of Sustainability, the potential is to replace the 153 existing platform called Enablon and Scope 2 and Scope 3 Reporting which are areas that are being developed. We need support of 154 partners like EY and Deloitte who are advising the Sustainability team at ABG. 155 3.3 Technical Account Plan & Specialized Services Themes 156 3.3.1.1 Technical Account Plan 157 ABG entities have been consuming cloud services through various partners and each entity has its own AWS account and cloud 158 strategy. In 2021, BMCSL proposed a strategy for centralized procurement, governance and management of Cloud/AWS Services for 159 group entities under a program called - ABG Cloud Konect. BMCSL has setup a control tower and has been engaging with different 160 ABG entities to have them join BMCSL’s AWS Organization. In this model, BMCSL provides shared cloud services, security, network 161 and governance while each entity is responsible for managing its workload in their own AWS Org under BMCSL.  As of now, adoption 162 of ABG Cloud Konect is slow but expected to pick up in coming years. However, such a model doesn’t exist for ABC Shared IT, which 163 provides shard services to ABC entities.  164  165 AB Capital and ABG Manufacturing entities adopted/started adopting Cloud in almost all areas except areas having dependencies on 166 hardware/licensing/partners. ABG has a multi-cloud strategy with AWS as the preferred CSP in consumer facing apps/digital 167 workloads and workloads like SAP, Analytics. Mr. Birla has given a mandate to entities to think and build strategy on digital initiatives 168 – Data and Insight, Smart Safe Sustainable Manufacturing (3SM), Adoption of Low-Code No-Code (LCNC) Platform and API enable 169 businesses. Teams have been formed at corporate level to drive these initiatives. We are working closely with API and 170 3SM/Manufacturing team on enablement through T&C, Workshops and Immersion days to build AWS Services mindshare.   171  172 1/Nurture ABC engagement next level by leveraging FSI/specialized team to help ABC on data, AIML strategy, platform along with 173 COI/working backward sessions. At ABFL, In next 6 months the plan is to work closely with the new CDO and help review exiting 174 Customer Journey/Onboarding/digital lending platform from domain and tech perspective to identify improvements in partner 175 onboarding, B2B Integrations and new digital offerings. Selling through partners is one of the key priority areas for ABFL, currently, 176 ABFL has lending and collection partnership with Paytm and BharatPe. ABSLI and ABHF is slow in moving to the cloud (ABSLI has 177 migrated around 20+ Apps and ABHF 10+). For Svatantra Microfinance plan is to build modernize, integrate system (basis Chaitanya 178 M&A) & new analytics use cases on (Lending and Collection Data). but we are engaged and encouraging customer to parallelly 179 modernize the migrated workloads. At ABSLI priority is to take Textract/IDP to production and scaling AIML/SageMaker at ABHF to 180 around 10 Models into production 2/At ABFRL focus would be on modernizing, optimizing and extending the eComm architecture 181 with additional AWS, Partner solutions 3/With Ultratech focused is on SAP migration, production line optimization & building 182 advanced analytics/AIML use cases for Dealers, Transportation and Consumer data, Account team is also increasing AWS foot print 183 in Manufacturing Apps which will be one of the focus areas for next few years. 4/We are actively engaged with Grasim on IDF 184 initiatives, improving their capacity utilization & building supply chain control tower and manufacturing dashboard. Also engaged 185 with WWSO and Cognite/ASPEN Tech  - our ISV Partner, to jointly work on use cases like sustainability, energy optimization and 186 other advanced analytics use cases by unlocking data stored in ASPEN historian.

ABG has tied up with small startups and ISV vendors to for fit 516 to purpose point in solution but finds it difficult to build broader use cases across many isolated solution   517 2) Key Trends - AWS Services  518  519 Some of the key trends in the account are as below -  520  521 Compute: Both ABG and ABC workloads are compute heavy on EC2, however ABC, ABFRL entities have started using ECS and EKS and 522 preferring EKS as a preferred container platform. Most of the workloads are compute optimized – using AMD processors and also 523 started using Graviton for RDS deployment. Team is also taking advantages of auto-scaling and recently started committing to 524 Savings Plan and RI for all the production workloads. At ABSLI G4dn/G5dn instances are being used for AIML workload.  525 ASK - [1] Sufficient availability of latest gen AMD-powered instances such as c6a, r6a & m6a, and G4dn in AWS BOM region for cost 526 advantages, capacity request is already done. [2] WWSO Compute team, Partner team to workout mechanism to make Fargate cost 527 attractive compared to EC2, customer compares EC2 AMD cost with Fargate. Though Fargate is a managed service, customer doesn’t 528 get equivalent cost reduction in managing Fargate from MSP compared to managing EC2 cost [3] While ABSLI/ABFL has started using 529 Graviton-powered instances for RDS, there are a 3rd party COTS products and endpoint software’s (such as Trend Micro, Veeam) 530 running in ABSLI environment where these products can’t run on instances with ARM processors. help and support here would 531 increase the adoption of Graviton instances.  532  533 Databases & Analytics: 534 [1] ABG and ABC today prefers running DBs on EC2 in self-managed mode because cost of RDS is much higher compared to running in 535 EC2. Customer gets DBA, admin support as part of MSP contract so RDS management is not really benefiting customers in terms of 536 cost so there are limited RDS deployments. For new app, customer prefers MySQL/Postgre as DB and open to port their commercial 537 DB to open source DB but need AWS skin in the game.  538 [2] ABG and ABC has invested in Teradata, SQL DW, SSIS and Informatica for their data and data engineering needs. Though at most 539 entities DWs is still running on-prem but some ABG and ABC entities have taken the liberty to setup Analytics platform, for specific 540 use cases, on AWS cloud which uses either Redshift or DL or both along with other analytics services - Glue, EMR and Athena. 541 Reporting tools used are – Qlik, GSquare, PowerBI and QuickSight. Most ABG entities has got PowerBI as their standard reporting BI 542 tool and on AWS Cloud reporting is done using Qlik/Power BI and QuickSight. Each entity at ABG has a choice to decide on Analytics 543 Platform (AWS/Azure). Off late, Databricks is getting popular within ABG entities and being promoted by GDNA group. 544  545 ASK - [1] From Late last year, the general recommendation from GDNA team is to standardize on Databricks as DE and DS platform 546 on both AWS, Azure. AWS account and Specialized team has offered an integrated platform (SageMaker+EMR) against Databricks to 547 be considered while evaluating analytics needs. A POC is also being proposed to GDNA team using AWS Platform against Databricks. 548 ABG being a cost sensitive organization, need a financial construct (special pricing) for Analytics workloads on Databricks as MS has a 549 control on Databricks pricing. [2] Need support from DB, Data Lab and Analytics Specialist team to enable ABG entities to migrate to 550 open source DB platform and DW modernizations from both tech and commercial areas. Also need help to setup a framework to 551 continuously optimize Analytics cost.  552  553 Application Modernization: 554 All new applications that are being deployed on cloud are architected using cloud native architecture, ABC team appreciates the 555 value being provided by AWS Managed and Serverless platform. But the applications migrated to the cloud as lift and shift are only 556 optimized for infra and modernization generally takes a back seat due to vendor dependency and complexities associated in re-557 platforming/modifying/packaging applications. Only few applications – ABFRL eCom, ABFL LOS, ABFL Wealth and few others are 558 Modernized post migrations because of availability of inhouse team. ABFL wealth is completely modernized at all layers - Infra 559 (Serverless), Platform (Open source) and application (Microservices and DevOps), because of inhouse app team.  560  561 Security: 562 ABC entities have matured security controls in their AWS environments and have defined security standards for network traffic, 563 handling sensitive data and security threats on AWS. ABHF has implemented control tower with required guardrails and ABSLI has 564 got Landing zone implemented. ABFL and ABC doesn’t have landing zone implemented but they have required security control in 565 place. ABC Companies uses security services like CT, Guard Duty, AWS Config, Security Hub, Macie and Inspector along with 3rd party 566 security solutions for endpoint protection (CrowdStrike), Securonix(SIEM), ZScalar(Zero Trust), security appliances for network 567 Page 16 of 23  protection (CheckPoint and Palo Alto). ABG group entities are not as mature as ABC entities and because of relax regulations, 568 adoption of managed AWS Security services is also slow.  569  570 3) Key Tech initiatives: 571 While there are many identified opportunities around workload migrations – Windows/SAP/People, Analytics, AI/ML. Based on the 572 growth and criticality of the workloads to the business – Account team will drive initiatives on: 573  574 Build Data Platform for One ABC: Each ABC entity has developed D&A platform on cloud which is serving insights required for that 575 entity, there are no group wide use cases/strategy considered across entities. Recently ABC has formed an org call One ABC, the 576 intent is to leverage entities data, derive new insights and build value added services required at ABC group level along with a Super 577 App as an gateway to interact with entities digital services. Plan here is to leverage WWSO - Analytics, AIML, Data/AIML labs and 578 help ABC team in building strategy, brainstorm use cases and build underlying tech platform to serve the need. Plan is to work with 579 One ABC CTO to help him make tech decisions on platform and also start AWS evangelization – sessions, workshops for his team    580  581 Platform and App Modernization: ABFL adopted app modernization for Wealth Platform and achieved a cost saving of around 40% 582 compared to onprem DC spend. We have proposed and trying to replicate similar transformation at ABSLI and ABHF for migrated 583 applications to AWS cloud. Having infra optimization is in place, the plan is to pick/identify noncritical candidate applications for re-584 platforming OS (Win to Linux) and DB (Licensed to Open source). The current DB Platform is SQL and Oracle) [Time frame is 3-9 585 months]. After/in parallel to re-platforming, the plan is to start application modernizations (Containerization /serverless) wherever 586 applicable [Time frame 6-12 months]. The plan is to closely monitor cost and agility at app level to ensure customer understand cost 587 and agility gains pre and post modernization and excitement can be created to take this journey to other workloads. To have this 588 successfully completed, looking for help from  589 • DevX/CSM team to help in application modernization evangelization/EBA and ensure customer outcomes are being met 590 • ProServ help to modernize at least two apps and a competent partner who can take this journey forward. ProServ presence 591 help build customer confidence and success help replicate these initiatives at larger scale within entity and across entities.  592 • Tech help from DB team during planning and DB migration and also offer program like DB freedom. Help in conducting 593 Babelfish App Modernization and plan a POC using Babelfish 594 • Explore possibility of using the Database Migration Accelerator (DMA) service at ABG group level 595 Manufacturing Workload: Increase foothold in Manufacturing, IIoT and Supply Chain  596 1. ProServ has developed IIoT digital twin use case for 3SM team (Predicting - process parameters, Quality) for Hindalco 597 Mahan Plant. To replicate the IIoT use case and scale it, we are planning following activities in next 3-6 months 598 a. 3SM team enablement with trainings on – IoT Telemetry, Machine Learnings Fundamentals, AWS IoT Services. Also 599 conduct workshop on- AWS Edge Services – Greengrass and SiteWise, Smart factory/AWS for Industrial and 600 SageMaker. This ensure Customer adopts Native AWS IIoT Services and will plan proposing prototypes for Services 601 like Greengrass, SiteWise, Monitron, LK4V and LK4E. GDNA is open to evaluate Greengrass as an edge platform. 602 b. Help build IIoT CoE at ABG 603 c. Help 3SM team to onboard partner who can take handover from ProServ on developed use cases 604 d. Create a plan to replicate the developed use cases at other entities 605 2. Leverage WW smart factory team and work with AspenTech to formulate a strategy to centralized historians on AWS Cloud 606 which will open the door to build industrial use cases on data collected from machines and other systems on AWS Cloud. 607 3. Partner lead engagement for optimizing ABFRL apparel manufacturing operations – engaged with Deloitte and 608 Tulip/Pentagon to convince customer to start a small scale POC 609 4. Leverage Specialized/Manufacturing team to plan migration of Grasim manufacturing Dashboard to AWS Cloud and 610 leveraging WW Mining and Manufacturing team for a suitable partner for UTCL mining solution – ShiftWise mining work 611 scheduling, work optimization and equipment monitoring – which requires daily resources planning, resource tracking and 612 asset pdm.  613 5. Engage with Grasim for a small-scale Pulp Control Tower application POC, Manufacturing team is helping with solution and 614 partner 615 6. Using Amazon forecast for Retail demand forecast across SKUs 616  617 Security: 618 - Setup Control Towers for ABC, ABFL and ABFRL By Sept 2023 619 - Arrange AWS Security enablement Workshop, increase AWS Security Services mindshare and conduct reviews to identify 620 strengths/gaps at Top Accounts – ABFL, ABFRL by Aug 2023. 621 Page 17 of 23  - Establish Cloud Security CoE function in ABFRL,ABFL,BMCSL by year end. The idea is to enable this team to take best 622 practices and lesson learnt to complete group 623 ASK – [1] Support from Control Tower Service team - Need help in a scenario where customer is setting up control tower with 624 reselling partner. What customer is looking at is a facility to let customer keep root account creds of Mgmt. Account without billing 625 access and partner gets billing access without requiring to keep root credentials. [2] Enablement support from security team during 626 security gamedays, immersion days and help in setting up Cloud Security COE team 627 Cost Optimization: 628 Over last few months, we have optimized AWS Cloud cost at ABFL, ABFRL, UTCL, ABSLI on an average at around 7-8 % of the AWS Bill 629 via Cost enablement sessions, sharing reports and helping optimize cost across infra modernizations, storage optimization, improve 630 utilization and elasticity. The challenge is post CO recommendations partner and customer team takes longer to implement 631 recommendations.     632  633 Below is the current CO Score at ABG Level  634  635  636  637 - Plan is to improve CO score to 50 from 33 by year end.  638 - Will increase CO review frequency to per quarter. Leverage CSM for MAP 2.0 Accounts – ABLSI, ABHF, ABFL  639 - Establish CFM CoE team for ABFRL and ABFL. Equip this team with all the best practices and toolset so that these CO 640 practices can be done on continuous basis at entity level and take these learnings and best practices to the rest of ABG 641 Group.  642 ASK - [1] Need help from AWS CFM team to setup a cloud cost management function within large AWS Biller Accounts - ABFL and 643 ABFRL [3] Help from CSM team for atleast MAP 2.0 customers to take lead and ensure cost optimization recommendation are being 644 taken to production successfully. [2] An easy mechanism to charge back to entities for consuming API based services/AIML services 645 like Textract and in general charge back for shared services like bandwidth/TG charges 646  647 Architecture Advisory: For Retail, ABFRL – Plan is to engage and do Architecture Advisory around tech and functional blocks for   648 existing eCom Application. The review outcomes will be aligned with customer needs and focus on identifying opportunities to 649 leverage new AWS Services/ISV solutions to help achieve business outcome and strengthen existing architecture thru better 650 security/resiliency/performance/CO. Plan to complete this activity by Aug 2023  651  652 ASK - [1] Need help AWS Retail team on review and CSM team to ensure agreed recommendations are being successfully taken to 653 productions.    654  655 Services Adoption:  Below table shows top service usage within the Group.  656  657 Service Group Name YTD Revenue Prev YTD Revenue YTD Y/Y Compute $578,752 $437,975 ▲ 32.1% Database $124,163 $85,163 ▲ 45.8% Management Tools $51,513 $25,735 ▲ 100.2% Storage $50,779 $30,104 ▲ 68.7% Networking $38,412 $22,562 ▲ 70.3% Desktop & App Streaming $30,529 $249 ▲ 12161.3% Analytics $24,897 $12,593 ▲ 97.7% Security, Identity & Compliance $14,512 $6,037 ▲ 140.4% Machine Learning $2,005 $1,139 ▲ 76.0% 
Page 18 of 23   658 To drive purpose-built services usage, the plan is to conduct two workshops every quarter with ABG Manufacturing, Retail and ABC 659 entities. For Manufacturing, the focus would be to evangelize AWS Purpose built Industrial IoT/AIML Services (SiteWise, IoT Event, 660 L4E, L4V, Monitron, Panorama). ABC capital entities are adopting AIML for selective use cases (Credit decisioning, underwriting Risk 661 modeling) via ISV solutions, custom models on EC2 and also started adopting SageMaker. Plan is to double down on SageMaker 662 growth (Take 10 models to production in ABHF) and increase mindshare on Textract, Contact Center Intelligence (CCI), Forecast, 663 Personalization, Kendra.   As an outcome of these workshops across Capitals, Manufacturing and Retail accounts, we are looking to 664 start at-least one prototype/use case in each domain either on – CbM/Condition based Monitoring, PdM/Predictive Maintenance, 665 Visual Quality Inspection, Worker Safety. On ABC/Retail side will target Contact Center Intelligence - Post and Live Call Analytics, Self 666 Service Virtual Agents, Intelligent Document Processing, Forecasting, Personalization, Intelligent Search, Retail Store Video Analytics. 667  668  669 4) What’s working well: 670 1. Preferred cloud service provider for ABFL, ABSLI, ABHF, Svatantra with core and consumer facing workloads running on AWS. 671 We have reasonable coverage with entities like - UTCL, ABFRL, Textiles, Thai-Chemicals, OS/TAF, Corporate, GDNA  672 2. ABSLI and ABHF has Landing zone/Control Tower environment in place. BMCSL has also setup control tower with shared - 673 security services, network and governance framework on AWS to offer to entities.  674 3. AI/ML Engagements started at ABHF (SageMaker), ABSLI (Partner solution)  675 4. Enablement: Key team members in ABSLI, GDNA ABFL got AWS Certified and targeting at least 5 more this year. 676 5. Similar to ABFL success; ABSLI & ABFRL has started App Modernization using Lambda, API Gateway, Containers (EKS and 677 ECS)-Fargate, RDS Graviton. Increased usage of AWS Platform Services will deliver significant value and make AWS 678 workloads stickier. ABFRL is building Super App - consolidating different brands in to one app. using API Gateway, Lambda 679 and EKS.  680 6. Increased discussions around Supply Chain, IOT along with deeper coverage from AM, SA, ISR and WWSO functions 681  682 5) What’s not working: 683 1. Commercial / Vendor products & solutions – Resistance from ISVs to modernize solution running on AWS Cloud. Ex (A3S, MF 684 Platform). Need help to proactively work with ISVs to ensure commercial licensing (SQL, Oracle DB) doesn’t provide edge to 685 competition and explore options with ISVs to move DB to open DB platform/Aurora.  686 2. Need help to Offset Licensing advantage, apart from commercial benefits during covered in MAP Programs  687 3. GDNA Traction towards Databricks platform in ABG group - reasons being simple to use, cost effective and a single 688 integrated tool for both data engineering and data science team. While we are trying to counter that by offering a POC 689 (Data Lab Build) using AWS integrated serverless platform (combination of SageMaker and EMR) but ABG’s speed is slow.  690 4. Limited development team as most of dev and management work is outsourced to partners. Having limited inhouse team 691 reducing modernization velocity. ABFL has an application called Wealth managed by inhouse team, it was very easy to 692 inculcate the idea and drive it, the app was running on Microsoft platform on prem, but because of internal team, it was 693 very easy to complete modernization, similar is the case with ABFRL.  694 5. Good engagement with FSI, Retails businesses but manufacturing digitization is pretty slow and though Corp team is trying 695 to accelerate it but there is strong push back from Plant team. We will take help from SSOE/WW/ProServ team on what 696 should be our plan to penetrate and expand at Manufacturing entities  697 6. Enterprise Support Unavailability – Almost all ABG and ABC group companies are on Business Support for production 698 workloads. Enterprise support is expensive to buy for an individual entity level. What would be the ideal is to have an ES 699 support at ABG or ABC level. Without ES in place, several times the support tickets don’t get required attention resulting 700 escalation from customer side and lead to poor customer experience and also eat SA's time (SSOE and UTCL are recent 701 example where tech issues took weeks to resolve and provide root cause) 702 7. 2nd region availability –While AWS Region2 is now available, there is a need for AWS DRS to be available for DR workloads. 703 We are looking for partner solutions but customer is preferring AWS Native Service. 704 6) Tech Stakeholder Map:  705  706  #  Customer Exec  Title  Company  Relationship  AWS Exec  Remarks 1 Shrijeet Mishra Chief Innovation ABG Neutral Francessca Vasquez/ Ben Discuss about tech transformation in global conglomerates and build Page 19 of 23  Officer and Head  Group Services mindshare on strategic tech directions for ABG 2 Manish Gupta CIO ABG Supporter Anupam/Ekta Accelerate Manufacturing and Smart factories digital transformation 3 Ramesh Narayanaswamy CTO AB Capital Neutral Ekta Strengthen current partnership and identify  1-2 strategic FSI/fintech initiatives 4 Praveen Shrikhande CTO ABFRL Neutral Ekta Strengthen current partnership and identify  1-2 Retail initiatives 5 Vinoth Sivam CTO One ABC - Data Supporter Ekta/Ankit Layout tech strategy for building groupwide data insight platform  707 7) Detailed Oppty & Initiatives entity-wise 708   709    Opportunity  Key  Cust Outcome/Cust  Priority  AWS  Services/ISV  Competition  Play  Asks  & Challenge 1 Seamex HRMS Short term - Public Cloud Migration  and Long term - Modernization EC2,Storage, Databases, Monitoring  and Security services.

It operates in 50+ countries worldwide with an FY22-23 annual revenue of $25B (17% YoY Growth), PAT of 5.7% (21% YoY Growth), $50B order book and market capitalization of $56B. It is one of Asia’s largest vertically integrated Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) companies, and is a market leader in turnkey projects. The Company's manufacturing footprint extends across eight countries in addition to India.  L&T as the promoter holds 66% stake in L&T Finance (FY22-23 annual revenue of $1.5B), 69% stake in LTIMindtree (FY22-23 annual revenue of $4B) and 74% stake in LTTS (FY22-23 annual Revenue of $1 B) - the 3 other listed entities of L&T Group as on date. L&T broadly has 7 business verticals - Infrastructure projects, Hi-Tech manufacturing, Energy Projects, IT Services, Financial Services, Development projects and Realty. Infrastructure (EPC) segment contributes ~45% to consolidated revenue followed by services (~30%). ‘Lakshya’, the Group’s 5-year strategic plan was formulated and approved by the Board in FY 2021-22. Lakshya 2026 plans to achieve a) value-accretive growth of their current businesses - EPC Projects (Energy & Infrastructure) and Hi-Tech Manufacturing (Heavy Engineering, Defence, Electrolyzers, and Battery Energy Storage Systems), b) reducing/exiting noncore businesses, c) developing innovative business offerings catering to ride the energy transition wave, d) scaling up digital and e-commerce businesses (L&T Edutech, L&T Sufin and L&T Cloudfiniti) and e) business sustainability through sharper focus on ESG (committed to water and Carbon Neutrality by 2035 and 2040 respectively) and shareholder value creation (ROE of 18%+ by FY25-26).  L&T has a long-standing relationship with Microsoft with regular executive connects with Satya Nadella. L&T has been leveraging Microsoft as their primary CSP (Microsoft EA at ~10M+ ARR). Microsoft also maintain a 360-degree relationship with L&T providing reciprocal business to their IT companies: LTIMindtree & LTTS (Microsoft is erstwhile Mindtree’s largest customer; estimated $150M ARR). GCP is the incumbent vendor at L&T Finance.    2.1 Customer Strategic Priorities   L&T Group aims to generate a revenue of $32.9 Billion by March 2026 (17% growth in FY22-23). Lakshya 2026 plans to achieve value-accretive growth in the existing businesses through a multi-pronged approach of targeting opportunities arising out of global trends, with a focus on ESG and Sustainability. The underlying emphasis of Lakshya 2026 is to ride the momentum in existing and emerging technology trends for IT services, reorganise the business offerings to serve the customers better and drive profitability through operational excellence, value engineering and digitalisation initiatives.  [Adoption of Digital]: Use of AI, IoT and cloud computing to enhance customer experience and differentiate in a volatile market. Invest in high-growth areas such as data centers, cloud, AI, cybersecurity, and blockchain to add to existing capabilities and offerings.  L&T Cloudfiniti is aimed at offering cutting edge technology solutions through the state-of-the-art data centers and cloud infrastructure. [Growth of new ventures]: Drive growth by capitalizing on opportunities for new businesses like Green Energy (EPC), Data Centers, EduTech (Learning and Assessment platform), B2B e-commerce platform Su-Fin serving MSMEs in construction and industrial products. This priority is driven by SNS and key executives at L&T Construction and L&T Edutech  [Grow their IT services businesses]:  - L&T plans to grow its IT Services business (LTIMindtree, LTTS) to 50% of group revenue over the next 5 years (currently 27%).   [Divesting non-core businesses/assets]: In the past, L&T had made significant investments in concession projects such as metro rail (Hyderabad Metro), road operations and tolling (through L&T Infrastructure Development Projects Limited) and power (Nabha Power). However, the focus in recent years has been on reducing its exposure to such public-private partnerships (PPPs) through divestment. Edelweiss Alternatives has acquired 100% equity stake in L&T Infrastructure Development Projects Limited (L&T IDPL) from existing shareholders - L&T and CPP Investments in FY22-23. 3.0 AWS Strategy & Goals   Overall health status for the account and why   L&T Group (outside of LTIMindtree and LTTS which is managed by our ITS team) is an Early- Stage Greenfield account for us - the AWS revenue in 2023 from L&T Group was less than $75K ARR (largely PoCs – e2Log, Attendance Management System, Code Editor, LMS at Eductech, etc and storage/backup workloads at L&T Finance). To summarize, we do not have any L&T Group workload in production on AWS at the moment.  Over the years, this account has been a tough nut for us to crack given the clout and 360-degree relationship that Microsoft has in this account for more than a decade along with an Enterprise Agreement covering Office 365, Windows, SQL & Azure (Total Microsoft EA is ~$10M-$12M ARR). Some of the deals that we have contested and lost in the last couple of years include the Smart Manufacturing RFP At L&T Heavy Engineering, e2Log Middleware, LMS for Edutech, SuFin b2b platform etc.   In this year, we are working on both a scale (mapping entities like L&T Finance, L&T Realty, L&T Power, L&T Defense along with various key stakeholders at the Corp IT Team) with as well as depth motion (deepening existing relationships with L&T Construction, L&T Hydrocarbon, L&T Edutech and L&T Heavy Engineering) in this account. Though there is a lot of resistance to change, there is a possibility for the customer to look at a multi -cloud environment, provided we stay invested in our approach and endeavor to make them successful. In our engagement in the account in the last 4 weeks, we have unearthed 2 new significant opportunities – RISE with SAP for L&T Group across all their 15 instances ($1M ARR) and GCP/DC migration at L&T Finance (MAP 2.0)   We will have to build on the LT meetings we have had in the past - with the CEO and MD of L&T - SN Subrahmanyan (with Adam Selipsky, Puneet, Vaishali, Raghu), R Ganesan (Head of L&T Construction), Mahesh Chikodi (CDO) to earn trust and gain mindshare in this account. At a user level, we have to focus on and invest in AWS training and certification for the L&T teams across their various entities. We have to build AWS champions both at a leadership/business stakeholder level as well as user level in this account.   Our Partner strategy has been mostly for driving/accelerating PoCs - we need to create a partner eco-system which can create as well as drive multiple opportunities. We also need to have a joint GTM with LTIMindtree to create a plan for L&T group.   3.1 AWS Goals for the account   Ambition: L&T Group becoming a $1M Run rate account for AWS by 2026   [Goal #1] Getting our first production workload at L&T Group by H1 of FY24  [Goal #2] Get a foot at the door to contest all strategic opportunities in this account. Establish AWS as a partner of choice for all digital transformations, migration and modernization projects across L&T in FY24.   [Goal#3] Lead and win with AWS Industrial Sales plays 1/Industrial IOT & Digital Twin 2/Connected factories 3/Supply Chain 4/Quality 5/Worker Safety etc. along with industry specialists, BDSI, ProServe and partners   [Goal #4] Sign up at least one L&T case study in FY24 which will help in L&T being a reference customer externally and internally at L&T group.   [Goal #5] Plan an EBC and work on COI/DI workshops for the LT at L&T   [Goal #6] Explore One Amazon/Cross Amazon opportunities   3.2 Think Big Ideas  [TB 1 - Promote a culture of innovation and build AWS champions in the account]: L&T’s workforce across their core infrastructure and manufacturing entities are not trained to think, innovate and adopt digital as fast as the other companies in the similar space are moving. They are also dependent on partners to help them scale on cloud. To lead with COI, DI, WB workshops, Prototyping/Modax/Devax engagements to earn trust and build mindshare at the CXO level. At a user level, we need to invest in our relationship with L&T by offering complimentary trainings that can lead to certified AWS resources who can be our champions in the account.  [TB 2 – Explore and drive a Pan-Amazon relationship]: We need to explore Pan-Amazon opportunities (AWS T&C - L&T Edutech joint GTM/collaboration opportunities Amazon Pay-L&T Finance 2P/3P relationship for underwriting loans, LTTS for silicon/R&D, leasing land from L&T for our DCs, etc) leading to a larger relationship with L&T Group.   3.3 Technical Account Plan & Specialized Services Theme 3.3.1 Technical Account Plan  L&T Group has a centralized as well decentralized decision-making structure. While policies are defined centrally, initiatives are driven at an individual company level. If the individual companies decide to build instead of buy, their choice is always LTIMindtree and more often than not LTIMindtree leads with a Microsoft stack - we have to work with our partner team to educate the teams at LTIMindtree at newer app build out practices through an AppMod/ModAx workshop. Also, most of the entities at L&T including Construction, Hydrocarbon, Power, Corp IT have Azure ExpressRoute already set up. The following sections discusses the overall technology landscape, strategic technology initiatives & key workloads which SA teams will focus on to drive AWS adoption within the L&T Group.  3.3.1.1 Existing Technology Landscape ERP – EIP (in-house) at L&T Construction, Infor at L&T Heavy Engineering and L&T Defence, Rest of the Group is on SAP - 15 instances of SAP (S/4HANA and ECC) 3.3.1.2 Rapid pace of digital transformation  Under the direction of the Chairman, we see an increasingly aggressive adoption of technologies to drive L&T digital journey. Being present in these accounts at the right time and repeatedly demonstrating our value-proposition will help us grow our mind share and pivot ourselves in a long-term strategic relationship over the next 2-3 years.  3.3.1.2 Key Tech initiatives:  The L&T SA POD would be driving the following technology initiatives. 1/Migration of Key Workloads 2/DC Exit 3/Security Assessments 4/Adoption of AWS  The identified initiatives stem from the concerns highlighted by the customers, issues encountered in ’23 as well as global AWS campaigns to adopt the latest AWS Regions / Services.  3.3.1.3 What’s working well:  1/ Over the past 4 weeks, we have had in-person meetings with the CXOs at all the 6 entities of L&T (listed in SFDC) along with the Group CDO - SAP Practice Head at L&T Corp; GM-IT at L&T IDPL; CDO, CTO and Head – IT Infra at L&T Finance; CDO, GM-IT, Digital Transformation leads at L&T Realty; GM-IT at L&T Construction, GM-Projects at L&T Hydrocarbon and Head-IT at L&T Power and initiated newer engagements as well as checking if we can get a window of opportunity to revisit and get engaged in some of the deals that we lost last year (Middleware for e2Log, HEIC RFP for Smart Manufacturing, etc)  2/Enablement Sessions (SA) – We have started with enablement sessions done for the L&T Construction team around OU creation best practices, website hosting, greenfield security controls and FSX file sharing. Post meeting with the Corp-IT team at L&T, we are working with our GenAI specialist team to conduct a half-day GenAI workshop for the Corp IT team at L&T. The detailed agenda for the workshop has been shared, awaiting confirmation reg the dates.   3.3.1.4 What’s not working:   Preference for L&T Cloudfiniti: The teams at L&T Power and Heavy Engineering have mentioned that that they are under a lot of pressure to move some of their existing workloads to L&T Cloufiniti. This is bound to go up for pure play IaaS workloads.   Pricing Comparison with Azure: While some group companies show interest in moving to AWS the deep discounts offered by Azure for existing workloads create a resistance for customer to adopt AWS. We have had at least 4 instances in FY23 where our pricing was on the higher side compared to Azure.  Retention of On-prem HW: Some of the entities have decided to retain the on-premise hardware as mandated by the Executive team. This happened for L&T HEIC opportunity after their review meeting with SNS where they were asked to retain the on-premises hardware and only take up cloud services for the new use cases or where infrastructure is not available on-premises.  3.3.2 Key Must Win Initiatives   1/ RISE with SAP for L&T Group: ($1M ARR) RISE with SAP opportunity at L&T Group for 15 instances – identified 3 weeks ago when we were presenting our PoV to the L&T Realty team – have met the Corp IT team and presented our key RISE with SAP differentiators to the SAP Practice Head and his team at L&T post this meeting. Next steps include a joint meeting with the SAP team in Feb to present our overall proposition.  2/ GCP/DC Migration at L&T Finance (MAP 2.0): We have initiated an overall migration conversation with L&T Finance (GCP incumbent) when we met their CDO, CTO and Head – IT Infra to present our NBFC PoV. Our follow-on meeting with the customer is scheduled for 20th Feb along with our Migrations team where we will be presenting a migration roadmap for them. The customer has shared their existing asset details – 1200+ VMs with 800+ VMs on GCP at the moment. 3.4 Priorities to Drive Execution  3.4.1 Priorities for Short Term (90 Days)  1/ AWS Training and Certification: We need to invest in our relationship with L&T by conducting complimentary Architecting on AWS (3-day hands on workshops) for the L&T teams in Chennai and Mumbai – we will get 25+ participants in each of these cities. This has be done once every quarter in this year. This will help us to drive up the no of AWS certified resources at L&T (non-existent currently compared to Azure which has 10+ certified people at Edutech, 5+ at Construction, 5+ at the Corp IT team, etc) with the possibility of converting a few of them as AWS champions in the account in the future.   2/ Landing Zone: Multiple entities at L&T including Construction, Hydrocarbon, Power, Corp IT have Azure ExpressRoute already set up. Ask: We need to invest in a Landing Zone setup for L&T through involvement of our ProServe team if required.  3/ Partner Strategy: Post our meeting with the current partner in this account (Pentagon) we realized that their role was limited to PoC acceleration/delivery. We laid out our expectations clearly to them in terms of they having more skin in the game post which they have designated an AM for L&T. Also, L&T Group’s preference for Build projects is LTIMindtree who tends to lead with a MS platform (case in point is the Attendance Management System for L&T Construction) – we have to work with our partner team to educate the teams at LTIMindtree at newer app build out practices through an AppMod/ModAx workshop. We need to work on the ISV mapping for L&T Group and also onboard regional partners who can help us create and drive new opportunities across L&T Group.  4/ Industry Mapping and positioning: Accelerate leading with our Industrial solutions a) Digital Twin b) Connected Assets and IoT c) Quality improvement d) AI/ML e) Energy Management/Sustainability to help improve efficiency, provide deeper insights, reduce project costs and improve margins.  3.4.2 Priorities for Medium to Long term (> 90 days)  1/Leverage Amazon EBC, COI, LFA, DI workshops: Lead with EBC, COI and WB workshops to build trust and earn mindshare at the CXO level across group entities  2/Industry Forums and events: Leverage Industry forums and round tables/executive meets to gain mindshare in the constructions/EPC industry in India where L&T has the biggest play. We need Marketing team’s proactively support identify at least one such event where we can secure a speaker slot in FY23. We also need help from our BDs to share information on any such global events where we can invite L&T  3/Mapping ISV partners across L&T Group: L&T uses ISV solutions extensively across their group entities. We will have to identify the current ISV eco system at L&T Group and its current deployment (possible migration opportunity if on Azure) b) Create GTM with new ISVs who can help build up industry solutions eg: Proserve along with support from Industry BD’s , ISV and partner teams.   3.5 Three Year AWS Revenue Goal  <<To be completed later>>  USD m 2024 Forecast 2025 Projection 2026 Projection ARR current Utility workloads 0 0.00 0.00 ARR from won/launched projects 0   ARR from Qualified+ pipe launches 0   ARR Gap (Opps to be Qualified) 0   Projected Utility Revenue 0.00 0.00 0.00 Proserve    Support    Training    -/- EDP Discount    -/- Credits    Other    Amortized Sales Revenue 0.00 0.00 0.00 % Y/Y        3.5.1 Commercial Considerations  Private Pricing: L&T Group currently does not have any PPA including LTIMindtree and L&T Technology Services. While we had initiated a discussion, they were hesitant to commit, reasons given as the uncertainty coming out of Covid and the merger of LTI and Mindtree. We will re-initiate this conversation in FY24.  3.6 Leadership Asks  4.0 Executive Engagement  [Priority 1 - Invite and plan a EBC and COI for L&T Group]: Plan at least one EBC and one Culture of Innovation workshop for key executives of L&T group in FY 2023. Basis the feedback, we can expand this across the group.  [Priority 2 - Plan a half yearly connect with MD of L&T Group]: L&T Group CEO is a key stakeholder in driving the larger L&T group strategies and decisions. We plan to fix a connect every 6 months to drive a better mindshare and a strategic engagement. 4.1 Executive Stakeholder Map  Executive Stakeholder Map is available in Appendix 1  5.0 Cross-Functional Plans 5.1 Partner  Till now, we have been working with partners for PoC delivery/acceleration - Pentagon for PoCs at L&T Construction, Ganit for AI/ML use cases, IBM for Weld Quality inspection, Flentas for LMS PoC at L&T Edutech, etc.   LTIMindtree will continue to play a bigger role within the group by working on larger transformational projects (like RISE with SAP) and new app build outs (like attendance management system). LTIMindtree’s preferred app stack tends to be on Microsoft – we need to work on a larger GTM with them specific to L&T Group. We do see PwC as the BCAP being active. We need to work towards identifying the various ISV partners who are active across the L&T group so that we proactively engage with them. Also, we need to identify regional partners who will help us create as well as drive new opportunities with L&T Group. 5.2 ProServe   Need to work with ProServe on Complimentary workshops (discovery, data modernization, etc), Landing zone set up and accelerating qualified Gen AI use cases.  5.3 Training & Certification   We need to invest in our relationship with L&T by conducting complimentary Architecting on AWS (3-day hands on workshops) for the L&T teams in Chennai and Mumbai – we will get 25+ participants in each of these cities. This has be done once every quarter in this year. This will help us to drive up the no of AWS certified resources at L&T (non-existent currently compared to Azure which has 10+ certified people at Edutech, 5+ at Construction, 5+ at the Corp IT team, etc) with the possibility of converting a few of them as AWS champions in the account in the future.   Explore the possibility of a joint GTM/tie up with L&T Edutech. 5.4 WWSO/Specialist org  IoT: We will work and widen our scope further with the current opportunities like Connected Machines, Digital Twin, Quality Inspection, worker safety. For account like L&T Heavy engineering, we will go with our full stack of IoT services while it will get integrated with the partner LTIMindtree’s offerings. We will drive the same sales plays in other greenfield accounts to enable faster digital transformation. We have to explore possible solutions for Supply chain/Material management for EPC industry MS Windows: MODERNIZATION: We will have to work with L&T to explore modernization of their windows and SQL based applications to reduce dependency on MS. We can offer to modernize a small subset of shortlisted windows-based applications. Based on the output, we can build a 3- or 5-year modernization roadmap to deliver operational efficiency, time to market, performance improvements, developer productivity, lower TCO. Co-invest in a modernization lab to deliver pilots for individual group companies to showcase business value of modernizing into cloud-native services.  MIGRATION: Establish Microsoft license optimization on-premise (EA outflows) and on the cloud (BYOL) as a key agenda with the Group Procurement Officer. Leverage AWS DC Divest program to accelerate cloud adoption. Help cloud adoption "laggards" with a simple path to the cloud through VMCA to showcase benefits of TCO optimization and easy migration.

It operates in 50+ countries worldwide with an FY22-23 annual revenue of $25B (17% YoY Growth), PAT of 5.7% (21% YoY Growth), $50B order book and market capitalization of $56B. It is one of Asia’s largest vertically integrated Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) companies, and is a market leader in turnkey projects. The Company's manufacturing footprint extends across eight countries in addition to India.  L&T as the promoter holds 66% stake in L&T Finance (FY22-23 annual revenue of $1.5B), 69% stake in LTIMindtree (FY22-23 annual revenue of $4B) and 74% stake in LTTS (FY22-23 annual Revenue of $1 B) - the 3 other listed entities of L&T Group as on date. L&T broadly has 7 business verticals - Infrastructure projects, Hi-Tech manufacturing, Energy Projects, IT Services, Financial Services, Development projects and Realty. Infrastructure (EPC) segment contributes ~45% to consolidated revenue followed by services (~30%). ‘Lakshya’, the Group’s 5-year strategic plan was formulated and approved by the Board in FY 2021-22. Lakshya 2026 plans to achieve a) value-accretive growth of their current businesses - EPC Projects (Energy & Infrastructure) and Hi-Tech Manufacturing (Heavy Engineering, Defence, Electrolyzers, and Battery Energy Storage Systems), b) reducing/exiting noncore businesses, c) developing innovative business offerings catering to ride the energy transition wave, d) scaling up digital and e-commerce businesses (L&T Edutech, L&T Sufin and L&T Cloudfiniti) and e) business sustainability through sharper focus on ESG (committed to water and Carbon Neutrality by 2035 and 2040 respectively) and shareholder value creation (ROE of 18%+ by FY25-26).  L&T has a long-standing relationship with Microsoft with regular executive connects with Satya Nadella. L&T has been leveraging Microsoft as their primary CSP (Microsoft EA at ~10M+ ARR). Microsoft also maintain a 360-degree relationship with L&T providing reciprocal business to their IT companies: LTIMindtree & LTTS (Microsoft is erstwhile Mindtree’s largest customer; estimated $150M ARR). GCP is the incumbent vendor at L&T Finance.    2.1 Customer Strategic Priorities   L&T Group aims to generate a revenue of $32.9 Billion by March 2026 (17% growth in FY22-23). Lakshya 2026 plans to achieve value-accretive growth in the existing businesses through a multi-pronged approach of targeting opportunities arising out of global trends, with a focus on ESG and Sustainability. The underlying emphasis of Lakshya 2026 is to ride the momentum in existing and emerging technology trends for IT services, reorganise the business offerings to serve the customers better and drive profitability through operational excellence, value engineering and digitalisation initiatives.  [Adoption of Digital]: Use of AI, IoT and cloud computing to enhance customer experience and differentiate in a volatile market. Invest in high-growth areas such as data centers, cloud, AI, cybersecurity, and blockchain to add to existing capabilities and offerings.  L&T Cloudfiniti is aimed at offering cutting edge technology solutions through the state-of-the-art data centers and cloud infrastructure. [Growth of new ventures]: Drive growth by capitalizing on opportunities for new businesses like Green Energy (EPC), Data Centers, EduTech (Learning and Assessment platform), B2B e-commerce platform Su-Fin serving MSMEs in construction and industrial products. This priority is driven by SNS and key executives at L&T Construction and L&T Edutech  [Grow their IT services businesses]:  - L&T plans to grow its IT Services business (LTIMindtree, LTTS) to 50% of group revenue over the next 5 years (currently 27%).   [Divesting non-core businesses/assets]: In the past, L&T had made significant investments in concession projects such as metro rail (Hyderabad Metro), road operations and tolling (through L&T Infrastructure Development Projects Limited) and power (Nabha Power). However, the focus in recent years has been on reducing its exposure to such public-private partnerships (PPPs) through divestment. Edelweiss Alternatives has acquired 100% equity stake in L&T Infrastructure Development Projects Limited (L&T IDPL) from existing shareholders - L&T and CPP Investments in FY22-23. 3.0 AWS Strategy & Goals   Overall health status for the account and why   L&T Group (outside of LTIMindtree and LTTS which is managed by our ITS team) is an Early- Stage Greenfield account for us - the AWS revenue in 2023 from L&T Group was less than $75K ARR (largely PoCs – e2Log, Attendance Management System, Code Editor, LMS at Eductech, etc and storage/backup workloads at L&T Finance). To summarize, we do not have any L&T Group workload in production on AWS at the moment.  Over the years, this account has been a tough nut for us to crack given the clout and 360-degree relationship that Microsoft has in this account for more than a decade along with an Enterprise Agreement covering Office 365, Windows, SQL & Azure (Total Microsoft EA is ~$10M-$12M ARR). Some of the deals that we have contested and lost in the last couple of years include the Smart Manufacturing RFP At L&T Heavy Engineering, e2Log Middleware, LMS for Edutech, SuFin b2b platform etc.   In this year, we are working on both a scale (mapping entities like L&T Finance, L&T Realty, L&T Power, L&T Defense along with various key stakeholders at the Corp IT Team) with as well as depth motion (deepening existing relationships with L&T Construction, L&T Hydrocarbon, L&T Edutech and L&T Heavy Engineering) in this account. Though there is a lot of resistance to change, there is a possibility for the customer to look at a multi -cloud environment, provided we stay invested in our approach and endeavor to make them successful. In our engagement in the account in the last 4 weeks, we have unearthed 2 new significant opportunities – RISE with SAP for L&T Group across all their 15 instances ($1M ARR) and GCP/DC migration at L&T Finance (MAP 2.0)   We will have to build on the LT meetings we have had in the past - with the CEO and MD of L&T - SN Subrahmanyan (with Adam Selipsky, Puneet, Vaishali, Raghu), R Ganesan (Head of L&T Construction), Mahesh Chikodi (CDO) to earn trust and gain mindshare in this account. At a user level, we have to focus on and invest in AWS training and certification for the L&T teams across their various entities. We have to build AWS champions both at a leadership/business stakeholder level as well as user level in this account.   Our Partner strategy has been mostly for driving/accelerating PoCs - we need to create a partner eco-system which can create as well as drive multiple opportunities. We also need to have a joint GTM with LTIMindtree to create a plan for L&T group.   3.1 AWS Goals for the account   Ambition: L&T Group becoming a $1M Run rate account for AWS by 2026   [Goal #1] Getting our first production workload at L&T Group by H1 of FY24  [Goal #2] Get a foot at the door to contest all strategic opportunities in this account. Establish AWS as a partner of choice for all digital transformations, migration and modernization projects across L&T in FY24.   [Goal#3] Lead and win with AWS Industrial Sales plays 1/Industrial IOT & Digital Twin 2/Connected factories 3/Supply Chain 4/Quality 5/Worker Safety etc. along with industry specialists, BDSI, ProServe and partners   [Goal #4] Sign up at least one L&T case study in FY24 which will help in L&T being a reference customer externally and internally at L&T group.   [Goal #5] Plan an EBC and work on COI/DI workshops for the LT at L&T   [Goal #6] Explore One Amazon/Cross Amazon opportunities   3.2 Think Big Ideas  [TB 1 - Promote a culture of innovation and build AWS champions in the account]: L&T’s workforce across their core infrastructure and manufacturing entities are not trained to think, innovate and adopt digital as fast as the other companies in the similar space are moving. They are also dependent on partners to help them scale on cloud. To lead with COI, DI, WB workshops, Prototyping/Modax/Devax engagements to earn trust and build mindshare at the CXO level. At a user level, we need to invest in our relationship with L&T by offering complimentary trainings that can lead to certified AWS resources who can be our champions in the account.  [TB 2 – Explore and drive a Pan-Amazon relationship]: We need to explore Pan-Amazon opportunities (AWS T&C - L&T Edutech joint GTM/collaboration opportunities Amazon Pay-L&T Finance 2P/3P relationship for underwriting loans, LTTS for silicon/R&D, leasing land from L&T for our DCs, etc) leading to a larger relationship with L&T Group.   3.3 Technical Account Plan & Specialized Services Theme 3.3.1 Technical Account Plan  L&T Group has a centralized as well decentralized decision-making structure. While policies are defined centrally, initiatives are driven at an individual company level. If the individual companies decide to build instead of buy, their choice is always LTIMindtree and more often than not LTIMindtree leads with a Microsoft stack - we have to work with our partner team to educate the teams at LTIMindtree at newer app build out practices through an AppMod/ModAx workshop. Also, most of the entities at L&T including Construction, Hydrocarbon, Power, Corp IT have Azure ExpressRoute already set up. The following sections discusses the overall technology landscape, strategic technology initiatives & key workloads which SA teams will focus on to drive AWS adoption within the L&T Group.  3.3.1.1 Existing Technology Landscape ERP – EIP (in-house) at L&T Construction, Infor at L&T Heavy Engineering and L&T Defence, Rest of the Group is on SAP - 15 instances of SAP (S/4HANA and ECC) 3.3.1.2 Rapid pace of digital transformation  Under the direction of the Chairman, we see an increasingly aggressive adoption of technologies to drive L&T digital journey. Being present in these accounts at the right time and repeatedly demonstrating our value-proposition will help us grow our mind share and pivot ourselves in a long-term strategic relationship over the next 2-3 years.  3.3.1.2 Key Tech initiatives:  The L&T SA POD would be driving the following technology initiatives. 1/Migration of Key Workloads 2/DC Exit 3/Security Assessments 4/Adoption of AWS  The identified initiatives stem from the concerns highlighted by the customers, issues encountered in ’23 as well as global AWS campaigns to adopt the latest AWS Regions / Services.  3.3.1.3 What’s working well:  1/ Over the past 4 weeks, we have had in-person meetings with the CXOs at all the 6 entities of L&T (listed in SFDC) along with the Group CDO - SAP Practice Head at L&T Corp; GM-IT at L&T IDPL; CDO, CTO and Head – IT Infra at L&T Finance; CDO, GM-IT, Digital Transformation leads at L&T Realty; GM-IT at L&T Construction, GM-Projects at L&T Hydrocarbon and Head-IT at L&T Power and initiated newer engagements as well as checking if we can get a window of opportunity to revisit and get engaged in some of the deals that we lost last year (Middleware for e2Log, HEIC RFP for Smart Manufacturing, etc)  2/Enablement Sessions (SA) – We have started with enablement sessions done for the L&T Construction team around OU creation best practices, website hosting, greenfield security controls and FSX file sharing. Post meeting with the Corp-IT team at L&T, we are working with our GenAI specialist team to conduct a half-day GenAI workshop for the Corp IT team at L&T. The detailed agenda for the workshop has been shared, awaiting confirmation reg the dates.   3.3.1.4 What’s not working:   Preference for L&T Cloudfiniti: The teams at L&T Power and Heavy Engineering have mentioned that that they are under a lot of pressure to move some of their existing workloads to L&T Cloufiniti. This is bound to go up for pure play IaaS workloads.   Pricing Comparison with Azure: While some group companies show interest in moving to AWS the deep discounts offered by Azure for existing workloads create a resistance for customer to adopt AWS. We have had at least 4 instances in FY23 where our pricing was on the higher side compared to Azure.  Retention of On-prem HW: Some of the entities have decided to retain the on-premise hardware as mandated by the Executive team. This happened for L&T HEIC opportunity after their review meeting with SNS where they were asked to retain the on-premises hardware and only take up cloud services for the new use cases or where infrastructure is not available on-premises.  3.3.2 Key Must Win Initiatives   1/ RISE with SAP for L&T Group: ($1M ARR) RISE with SAP opportunity at L&T Group for 15 instances – identified 3 weeks ago when we were presenting our PoV to the L&T Realty team – have met the Corp IT team and presented our key RISE with SAP differentiators to the SAP Practice Head and his team at L&T post this meeting. Next steps include a joint meeting with the SAP team in Feb to present our overall proposition.  2/ GCP/DC Migration at L&T Finance (MAP 2.0): We have initiated an overall migration conversation with L&T Finance (GCP incumbent) when we met their CDO, CTO and Head – IT Infra to present our NBFC PoV. Our follow-on meeting with the customer is scheduled for 20th Feb along with our Migrations team where we will be presenting a migration roadmap for them. The customer has shared their existing asset details – 1200+ VMs with 800+ VMs on GCP at the moment. 3.4 Priorities to Drive Execution  3.4.1 Priorities for Short Term (90 Days)  1/ AWS Training and Certification: We need to invest in our relationship with L&T by conducting complimentary Architecting on AWS (3-day hands on workshops) for the L&T teams in Chennai and Mumbai – we will get 25+ participants in each of these cities. This has be done once every quarter in this year. This will help us to drive up the no of AWS certified resources at L&T (non-existent currently compared to Azure which has 10+ certified people at Edutech, 5+ at Construction, 5+ at the Corp IT team, etc) with the possibility of converting a few of them as AWS champions in the account in the future.   2/ Landing Zone: Multiple entities at L&T including Construction, Hydrocarbon, Power, Corp IT have Azure ExpressRoute already set up. Ask: We need to invest in a Landing Zone setup for L&T through involvement of our ProServe team if required.  3/ Partner Strategy: Post our meeting with the current partner in this account (Pentagon) we realized that their role was limited to PoC acceleration/delivery. We laid out our expectations clearly to them in terms of they having more skin in the game post which they have designated an AM for L&T. Also, L&T Group’s preference for Build projects is LTIMindtree who tends to lead with a MS platform (case in point is the Attendance Management System for L&T Construction) – we have to work with our partner team to educate the teams at LTIMindtree at newer app build out practices through an AppMod/ModAx workshop. We need to work on the ISV mapping for L&T Group and also onboard regional partners who can help us create and drive new opportunities across L&T Group.  4/ Industry Mapping and positioning: Accelerate leading with our Industrial solutions a) Digital Twin b) Connected Assets and IoT c) Quality improvement d) AI/ML e) Energy Management/Sustainability to help improve efficiency, provide deeper insights, reduce project costs and improve margins.  3.4.2 Priorities for Medium to Long term (> 90 days)  1/Leverage Amazon EBC, COI, LFA, DI workshops: Lead with EBC, COI and WB workshops to build trust and earn mindshare at the CXO level across group entities  2/Industry Forums and events: Leverage Industry forums and round tables/executive meets to gain mindshare in the constructions/EPC industry in India where L&T has the biggest play. We need Marketing team’s proactively support identify at least one such event where we can secure a speaker slot in FY23. We also need help from our BDs to share information on any such global events where we can invite L&T  3/Mapping ISV partners across L&T Group: L&T uses ISV solutions extensively across their group entities. We will have to identify the current ISV eco system at L&T Group and its current deployment (possible migration opportunity if on Azure) b) Create GTM with new ISVs who can help build up industry solutions eg: Proserve along with support from Industry BD’s , ISV and partner teams.   3.5 Three Year AWS Revenue Goal  <<To be completed later>>  USD m 2024 Forecast 2025 Projection 2026 Projection ARR current Utility workloads 0 0.00 0.00 ARR from won/launched projects 0   ARR from Qualified+ pipe launches 0   ARR Gap (Opps to be Qualified) 0   Projected Utility Revenue 0.00 0.00 0.00 Proserve    Support    Training    -/- EDP Discount    -/- Credits    Other    Amortized Sales Revenue 0.00 0.00 0.00 % Y/Y        3.5.1 Commercial Considerations  Private Pricing: L&T Group currently does not have any PPA including LTIMindtree and L&T Technology Services. While we had initiated a discussion, they were hesitant to commit, reasons given as the uncertainty coming out of Covid and the merger of LTI and Mindtree. We will re-initiate this conversation in FY24.  3.6 Leadership Asks  4.0 Executive Engagement  [Priority 1 - Invite and plan a EBC and COI for L&T Group]: Plan at least one EBC and one Culture of Innovation workshop for key executives of L&T group in FY 2023. Basis the feedback, we can expand this across the group.  [Priority 2 - Plan a half yearly connect with MD of L&T Group]: L&T Group CEO is a key stakeholder in driving the larger L&T group strategies and decisions. We plan to fix a connect every 6 months to drive a better mindshare and a strategic engagement. 4.1 Executive Stakeholder Map  Executive Stakeholder Map is available in Appendix 1  5.0 Cross-Functional Plans 5.1 Partner  Till now, we have been working with partners for PoC delivery/acceleration - Pentagon for PoCs at L&T Construction, Ganit for AI/ML use cases, IBM for Weld Quality inspection, Flentas for LMS PoC at L&T Edutech, etc.   LTIMindtree will continue to play a bigger role within the group by working on larger transformational projects (like RISE with SAP) and new app build outs (like attendance management system). LTIMindtree’s preferred app stack tends to be on Microsoft – we need to work on a larger GTM with them specific to L&T Group. We do see PwC as the BCAP being active. We need to work towards identifying the various ISV partners who are active across the L&T group so that we proactively engage with them. Also, we need to identify regional partners who will help us create as well as drive new opportunities with L&T Group. 5.2 ProServe   Need to work with ProServe on Complimentary workshops (discovery, data modernization, etc), Landing zone set up and accelerating qualified Gen AI use cases.  5.3 Training & Certification   We need to invest in our relationship with L&T by conducting complimentary Architecting on AWS (3-day hands on workshops) for the L&T teams in Chennai and Mumbai – we will get 25+ participants in each of these cities. This has be done once every quarter in this year. This will help us to drive up the no of AWS certified resources at L&T (non-existent currently compared to Azure which has 10+ certified people at Edutech, 5+ at Construction, 5+ at the Corp IT team, etc) with the possibility of converting a few of them as AWS champions in the account in the future.   Explore the possibility of a joint GTM/tie up with L&T Edutech. 5.4 WWSO/Specialist org  IoT: We will work and widen our scope further with the current opportunities like Connected Machines, Digital Twin, Quality Inspection, worker safety. For account like L&T Heavy engineering, we will go with our full stack of IoT services while it will get integrated with the partner LTIMindtree’s offerings. We will drive the same sales plays in other greenfield accounts to enable faster digital transformation. We have to explore possible solutions for Supply chain/Material management for EPC industry MS Windows: MODERNIZATION: We will have to work with L&T to explore modernization of their windows and SQL based applications to reduce dependency on MS. We can offer to modernize a small subset of shortlisted windows-based applications. Based on the output, we can build a 3- or 5-year modernization roadmap to deliver operational efficiency, time to market, performance improvements, developer productivity, lower TCO. Co-invest in a modernization lab to deliver pilots for individual group companies to showcase business value of modernizing into cloud-native services.  MIGRATION: Establish Microsoft license optimization on-premise (EA outflows) and on the cloud (BYOL) as a key agenda with the Group Procurement Officer. Leverage AWS DC Divest program to accelerate cloud adoption. Help cloud adoption "laggards" with a simple path to the cloud through VMCA to showcase benefits of TCO optimization and easy migration. AI/ML: We will work towards 1/ Taking our AI/ML services across sales plays like Sagemaker (MLOps and LCNC), Intelligent Document Processing and Intelligent Search across L&T Group with ‘Art of possible’ session 2/One Data focus campaigns on use cases which spans across multiple service lines e.g. Predictive Maintenance in MFG using ML +ANA+ IoT 3/ Explore opportunities for Monitron led reliability maintenance, and run pilot with select group entities 4/Identify partners who can deliver use cases in the EPC industry 5/ML with Digital Innovation in which we would want to align ML use cases with an objective to enable customers to build an MVP on their selected AIML use case 5.5 BD/Growth programs   5.6 Functional teams  Marketing: We will seek support from Marketing to identify one event/executive round table for the constructions and EPC Industry and secure a speaker slot. Apart from this we will target events/sessions based on the executives/persona eg: CIO/CDO and Business vertical specific events eg: Global EPC Contract & Project Management Summit. We will also identify if there are events where L&T proactively participates so that we can use that opportunity for executive connect.
