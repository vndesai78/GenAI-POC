JAN 2024 | FY23 OP2 – FSI 
Amazon Confidential  Page 1 of 12 The purpose of this document is to give the reader an overview of the Financial Services business in India, some context around the 1 India nuances, key macro factors that are driving behaviour around cloud adoption, plans for FY24 and our big bets. 2 Vision: FSI vision is to be the ‘Transformation Partner’ of choice for the FSI Industry and a catalyst for cultural transformation and 3 Innovation. We want to be the largest CSP (primary/ preferred cloud provider) for the top 10 customers in Banking, Insurance, 4 Capital Markets and NBFC. Currently, we are meaningfully engaged at 7/10 Private sector banks (largest CSP at 4), top 9 insurers 5 (both life and non-life insurance companies, largest at 7) and 14 of 16 non-banking financial companies. We plan to enable Fintechs 6 to become the preferred rails for "Digital Public Infrastructure", while increasing our wallet share further to 85%+, from the current 7 79%. In the next 5 years, we aspire to build this into a $1B business. 8 1.0 Business Overview: 9 1.1 Historical trends, TAS, view of Greenfield, Net new vs. Recurring: 10 Financial Services segment covers ~$3B in TAS. Banking sub-segment is 11 by-far the largest with low penetration, which gives a significant 12 runway for growth, with the right regulatory conditions. 11% of these 13 accounts are Greenfield, representing 20% of the TAS. A big percentage 14 of this is in Public Sector Banks. The adjacent table gives a breakdown 15 of accounts covered in each segment, the associated GAR and TAS. A 16 deeper strategy to grow this segment is covered in our Think Big Plan. 17 Note: TAS data used for segmentation has data errors (e.g. Web3 applications, which represent Crypto, GAR is more than TAS). For the sake of consistency, we have used the same data 18 used for segmentation. Directionally, the spread of TAS and the overall numbers are realistic and should give a good idea of the industry. 19 1.2 Headwinds/ Tailwinds: 20 There are significant tailwinds in Banking, where rapid growth in digital payments and adoption of digital channels (post Covid) is 21 driving digital transformation projects across the industry. This largely drove the Fintech growth over the last few years, helped by 22 the exponential growth in UPI (digital B2C and C2C/P2P payments). UPI volume in Dec 2023 touched $208B (11.4B transactions). 23 UPI volume has grown at a CAGR of 168% from 2017-18 from $12B to $1.7T. Banks are increasingly looking at Cloud-first strategies 24 to drive Innovation as well as build resiliency and scalability for highly volatile workloads like payments. Indian FS market is still 25 largely underserved (only ~70% of Indians have Bank accts, with credit & insurance at <10% penetration), which provides a large 26 runway for growth for FS industry in India, beyond the current TAS. Large Private sector FS players are investing in modernizing 27 platforms to plan capacity for future growth driven by favourable demographics, and increasingly looking at cloud-native 28 architectures to drive business agility or lower costs (E.g.: Postgres is becoming the first choice over Oracle for CX workloads). Banks 29 are investing in in-house build capabilities esp. for Digital platforms, which positions AWS favourably due to our developer & startup 30 ecosystem in India. There are a few headwinds that might slow down revenue growth that are 31 largely uncontrollable. 1/ Cost. There is an intense focus on Cost Optimization as customers try to 32 put more governance on cloud costs. Cheap labour costs and favourable on-prem pricing is not 33 enabling a significant price differential in the early stages of the cloud journey. Traditional and 34 new players, like Adani and Jio, are coming up with competitive price-points for FS customers to 35 continue investing on-prem. 2/ Geo-political/ Regulatory uncertainty. Inconsistent policies (E.g. 36 Central Banking Digital Currency not allowed to go on public cloud; SEBI, Securities Regulator, has been sending mixed messages in 37 private conversations with regulated entities on moving critical workloads to public cloud) have created ambiguity and hence 38 cautiousness in any rapid movement to the cloud. RBI (Banking regulator) has also recently indicated an intent to offer its own cloud 39 facility for hosting critical workloads. Geo-political risks and an implicit nudge for an India cloud (owned/operated by an Indian 40 company) option is increasing complexity. NBFCs have also come under intense regulatory scrutiny and have been restricted to 41 grow some aspects (like lending). 3/ FX volatility is driving demand for INR pricing. 4/ Funding winter is expected to continue for 42 most of 2024. 2023 saw a precipitous drop in funding from $9.6B in 2021, $6B in 2022 to $2.1B in 2023 (Source: Tracxn), leading to 43 muted growth expectation of Fintech revenue in 2024. Crypto industry is also on the decline owing to regulatory ambiguity (Crypto 44 customers have already reduced usage by an avg. 12% in 2023). 5/ Increase in competitive activity, who are trying to reduce the 45 gap with aggressive pricing options, and INR pricing. Most Indian FSIs are India-focused and don’t have a large multinational 46 engagement. They don’t have a FX risk from their core business and do not want that to be introduced because of their IT spend. 47 1.3 Cloud/customer/segment maturity  48 Banks will continue to provide the largest runway for growth (45% of FSI TAS, 4% wallet share in terms of GAR), as seen in section 49 1.1. The journey started in 2020 and only private sector banks have begun their move to the cloud over the last 3 years. Public 50 Sector Banks (~$700M+ TAS) are poised to begin their journey this year and will be a Think Big bet for driving FS growth. Most 51 private sector insurers (e.g. ICICI Lombard, HDFC Life, BAGIC) and Capital Markets (e.g. Angel One, Motilal Oswal, HDFC AMC) 52 entities have moved most workloads to the cloud through Lift+Shift migrations. Modernization and migration of core systems, 53 Innovation, Data modernization, Gen AI will be key focus in these sectors. Private sector banks continue to be large buyers of ISV 54 solutions but are also starting to transform themselves into builders (e.g. HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, Kotak Bank), starting with CX and 55 Sub-Segment# AccountsTTM GAR$TASGAR % TASBanking53$56,276,852$1,302,471,8444%NBFC31$14,596,645$534,057,5403%Insurance41$35,987,140$450,006,8998%Payments64$200,910,108$356,767,63456%Capital Markets/Securities55$53,861,145$243,787,84822%Financial Services - Other13$6,983,625$17,955,57739%Web3 Apps (Crypto)5$18,408,776$17,560,996105%Software2$956,871$1,588,17060%Grand Total264$387,981,163$2,924,196,50813%

Amazon Confidential  Page 2 of 12 Digital Banking platforms. Fintech customers are largely all-in and the most mature cloud customers. Growth here will depend on 56 the growth of the Fintech sector. They are builders who are driving Innovation through technology.  57 1.4 Market segment positioning / Noteworthy 2023 progress/successes 58 2023 was a year of many firsts including large PPA’s with 2 of the Top 3 private sector Banks (HDFC Bank: $80M/5Y; Axis Bank: 59 $90M/5Y– largest for any CSP in India Enterprise FSI); Large SRRP deals with Zscaler at HDFC Bank (TCV: $40M/5Y) and ICICI Bank 60 (TCV: $62M/6Y), first Salesforce SRRP deal in AWS India at HDFC Bank, Deployment of secondary envt of CRMNext at Axis Bank. We 61 also saw acceleration of modernization of core workloads (e.g. TCS BaNCS Policy Administration System at SBI  GIC, and core digital 62 platforms like Optimus, Mobile+ Net banking, at IDFC First Bank, Thought Machine, Core Banking for new digital products, at IDFC 63 First and PayU). In Analytics, Amazon Redshift became a platform of choice at Angel One, Kotak Bank and Motilal Oswal. With 64 Fintech customers, there was significant progress around  1/ Graviton adoption (improved from ~5.5% in Jan-23 to 8.9% in Nov-23) 65 2/ Improved PPA  Coverage from 79%  to 86% of 2023 revenue; 24 (out of 52) customers under PPA. Wins: PayU ($60M/3Y), 66 Razorpay ($50M/3Y), Navi ($20M/5Y), and Bharatpe ($18M/3Y); 3/ Enterprise Support Penetration: 16 (out of top 20) on ES with 3 67 net-new wins in 2023. YTD Nov, strategic services adoption by Fintechs have grown 17% (~$54M in 2022 to ~$63M in 2023).   68 1.5 What is the 3Y/5Y vision? What will you be doing in 2024 to get closer to that vision? 69 We aspire to grow the FSI business to $1B in 5 years. Beyond the BAU Sales plays, we will continue to focus on the FSI Industry 70 Solutions IGA to drive business outcomes on AWS; deepen our Fintech engagement, increasing our wallet share by driving more 71 Pan-Amazon synergies and hence stickiness to AWS; making big bets around Public Sector Banks ($700M+ TAS) and 72 transformational DC Exits in a few large Private Sector banks, to drive significant growth in 3-5 years. Details in Think Big section.  73 2.0 FY23 Summary, observations, and learnings 74 2.1 Overall performance - vertical/segment 75 As highlighted in section 1.2, the 76 Banking segment is driving a healthy 77 growth ($53M, 68% Nov’23 YTD, YoY) 78 as the largest private sector banks 79 adopt a cloud first strategy to drive 80 Innovation, deliver better CX. Banks 81 have taken a measured approach to cloud adoption and have not embarked on large lift and shift initiatives. Instead, they are taking 82 a modernization approach to determine which applications need to be moved to the cloud. As applications have gotten complex 83 (like CRM, Loan management systems), the project and sales life cycles have increased (by 14-16%), leading to a slower growth rate 84 than years past (where growth was driven by non-critical applications). Public Sector Banks have just begun to consider cloud for 85 some of their transformation initiatives. We won the first few opportunities (CRMNext at Punjab National Bank, $3M/5Y) and Union 86 Bank of India ($600K ARR) that will begin their deployment journey in 2024. Insurance continues to have mixed growth ($28M, 17% 87 Nov’23 YTD, YoY) with some large accounts HDFC Life ($4.7M , -5% Nov’23 YTD YoY), BAGIC+BALIC ($2.65M, 14% Nov’23 YTD YoY), 88 ICICI Pru Life ($2.2M, 4% Nov’23 YTD YoY), in the final stages of their migrations. The current growth is being driven by core 89 modernization and data initiatives at Acko General Insurance ($2.1M, 86% Nov’23 YTD YoY), Max Life ($2.2M, 27% Nov’23 YTD YoY), 90 Star Health, ($1.3M, 52% Nov’23 YTD YoY). Capital Markets (50% YoY), with seen strong growth in 6 of the top 8 accounts, driven 91 by new app development and data initiatives at Angel Broking ($7M, 61% Nov’23 YTD YoY), DC Exit at HDFC AMC ($1.1M , 336% 92 Nov’23 YTD YoY). Fintech overall has slowed down due to the funding winter, as evidenced in section 1.2. E.g.: Razorpay (Usage -93 10% YoY), Cred ( -8%), Upstox (-19%), Simpl (-17%). However, the trends are mixed with sectors like Capital Markets (Quadeye: 94 +112%, Zerodha-32%), Digital Lending (Navi:+183%, Truebalance:+147%), and Insurtech (Acko:+77% Policy Bazar:+32%) have seen 95 growth while others like Crypto (Industry:-21%), and Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL, Slice:- 17%) have declined. Fintech customers like 96 Quadeye grew by entering new markets; Payments startups were focused on cross/upselling to their existing customers. E.g.: Navi 97 entered into insurance, mutual funds & wealth management and Zerodha diversified into fund management. Paytm growth was 98 also aided by consolidation of workloads on to AWS (~$10M ARR), from regions outside India. Apart from shutting down non-99 profitable business, Fintechs have also taken hard measures such as RIF(Reductions in workforce) e.g.: Cred (35%), PayU (6%), 100 Polygon (20%), CoinDCX (25%) to increase the runway in their business.  101 2.2 Key callouts on team structure, tenure, culture, diversity, connections scores, hiring, RA/URA 102 The FS team comprises of 38 resources (35 BIS), which includes 3 FLMs (tenure ranging from 6-10 years at 103 Amazon); 33 ICs (30 BIS, 3 Women); 1 FSI ISV BD and 1 Program Manager. 39% of the team is less than 2 years 104 at Amazon, while 42% of the team is over 4 years at Amazon, making it a healthy mix of relatively new and 105 tenured Amazonians. Diversity Ratio needs to be improved and we will be intentional in the hiring of TBHs. There 106 are also 2 employees currently on Pivot and 1 employee (RA) serving a notice period. All managers are new to 107 their teams and connection score are not available, right now, that reflects the sentiment of the new org. FSI org 108 has 4 L5s, 24 L6s and 7 L7s, apart from 3 L7Ms as FLMs. The 3 FLMs have 9 (ENT FSI Focus), 10 (Fintech) and 13 (ENT FSI Deep) as 109 span of controls. FSI Segment leader will have 6 people reporting directly as outlined at the beginning of this section, with the 110 addition of the AM for SBI, who will report directly for span of control purposes.

We have been intentional about our team’s wellbeing/development and 112 executing it through 3 pillars 1/FSI Weekly Connect: We bring the FSI sellers together every week to collaborate with functional 113 teams like Partner, ProServe, Training, Marketing team etc. to make our FSI customer successful in their cloud journey. 2/FSI 114 Falcons: FSI AMs, SAs and BDSI teams come together monthly to learn and share insights on new use cases deployed, customer 115 innovations, Progress made with our FSI customers and go deep with some of marquee wins and solutions to make it a repeatable. 116 We will continue both of these engagements in FY24. 3/Upskilling and Career Development: We initiated the ENT Enablement 117 Friday series in 2023 to upskill/enable our team on themes like FSI Specific solutions/ offerings, Industry Specific solutions, Strategic 118 Services, Executive Engagement and Sales Skills sessions led by FE and Industry teams. In FY24, we will plan 20 such enablement 119 workshops and drive programs like FSI/Fintech Ready Program GenAI Refresher Program, Growth Mindset Program. FSI Path’shala’ 120 is a monthly enablement mechanism where we invite strategic ISVs to present their FSI Industry Solutions and USPs. Objective is to 121 equip AWS account teams with functional understanding of the solution and be able to make an initial pitch to FSI customers. Last 122 year we conducted 15 FSI Path'shala sessions and this year we plan to conduct 20. 123 2.3 Successes / performance outcomes against strategy (strategic services) 124 Migrations, Data/ Analytics/ AIML, ISV solutions were key sales plays in 2023. ISV progress is covered in the IGA update. Migrations 125 continue to work well, driving good growth in ENT FSI. Against a 2023 stretch target of $36M migration ARR, we have closed 21 126 (30% of ENT) MAPs with a migration ARR of $51.4M (143% of stretch target). Major migration wins have been from Insurance ( 6 127 out of 21 wins) and Banks (9 out of 21 wins) and rest from NBFC (4, including 1 from Bajaj Finance Ltd, Microsoft’s largest NBFC 128 account), Capital markets(2). In the Fintech space, we have identified 5 Migration prospects (Phone pay, Billdesk, Paisa Bazaar, 129 Wimbo, CC Avenue)  with $25M TAS in our cohort where we plan to close min 2 MAP wins ($3M) in 2024 and acquire all 5 customers 130 ($20M) by FY26. The FSI AI/ML revenue grew by 16% ($1.85M, Nov’23 YTD), driven by 27% growth in the Fintech segment ($785K 131 Nov’23 YTD), led by Paytm ($380K Nov’23 YTD, 100% YoY). The FSI Ent segment grew at 10%($1.3M Nov’23 YTD) owing to degrowth 132 in IDFC First Bank (Nov YTD, $572K, -17% YoY, owing to EDP and Sagemaker Savings plan discounts) and RBL Bank ($90K Nov’23 133 YTD, -52% YoY, due to reduced experimentation and stopping usage of Transcribe). The Analytics revenue grew by 25% ($17.8M, 134 Nov’23 YTD), driven by a 76% growth in FSI Ent segment ($7M, Nov’23 YTD) led by Angel Broking ($1.1M, Nov’23 YTD, 313% YTD, 135 YoY). 2023 saw a healthy 75% Partner attach rate for the Ent FSI segment, up from 70% in 2022, led by collaboration with GSI’s like 136 Deloitte (Indusind Bank, Axis Bank), Accenture (AU Small Finance Bank), TCS (Max Life). In FY’23 YTD (till Oct’23), strategic services 137 contribution to Fintech accounts contribution has increased by 9% (2023 YTD at $51.5M vs FY22 YTD at $47.5M); Database is at 138 $24.7M 2023 YTD, 10% YoY, Containers  at $17.5M 2023 YTD, 14% YoY, Analytics at $8.67M 2023 YTD, -4% YoY and AI/ML is at 139 $0.61M 2023 YTD, 24% YoY. Details in Appendix 4. Gen AI update in Appendix 5. 140 3.0 FY24 execution plan and initiatives 141 Bottoms-up optimistic projections for 2024, 142 submitted by the team in late Nov, was 143 translating to a 13% YoY growth rate (29% for 144 ENT FSI and 3% for Fintech). We have since 145 reworked our forecasts, identified 146 opportunities, worked on pipeline targets for a 147 Fast start (see Appendix 2), factored early outcomes of some Big Bets (FSI ISV, PSB) which now translates to a 22% YoY growth rate 148 (40% ENT FSI and 10% Fintech), which is significantly better than the Nov Forecasts, but still carries risk in Fintech Forecast, 149 especially. We are identifying a PTG for the remaining gap over the next few weeks. In summary, we continue to expect growth in 150 the Banking and Capital Markets verticals. Insurance will be muted but will grow at a moderate pace. There is limited baseline 151 erosion in Enterprise FSI accounts (E.g. NSE $2.55M, RBL $1.57M) but there are headwinds in Fintech. In Fintech, Quadeye (Entered 152 new markets, and crypto) and Paytm (consolidation from other regions to India) had one-time events in 2023 that will not recur in 153 FY24. We expect our big bets to start paying dividends in FY25 and beyond and are confident of reaching $1B in 5Y. 154 Revenue Concentration: Top 19% (32 out of 171) of 155 the accounts, when viewed at a parent level, drive 80% 156 of FSI Revenue. At the child level, this translates to Top 157 17% of the 264 accounts driving 80% of the revenue. 158 However, the long tail of FSI is growing at a much faster 159 rate than the top accounts, which should help reduce concentration. 160 3.1 Sales motion implementation and verticalization 161 Sales Motions: The FSI Deep (ENT) segment ($66M YTD Nov’23), comprises 13 Banks (~$1B TAS, 7 PSU, 6 Private Sector Banks) 162 including subsidiaries and 1 large NBFC group (Bajaj Finserv) and will be addressed with 14 AMs (12 BIS, 1 open HC, 1 to be raised), 163 and 14 SAs. To drive optimal coverage, accounts >500K ARR will have 1:1 AM to account coverage ratio, with 5 Greenfield PSU Banks 164 at 1:2.5 coverage ratio. The key pillars of our GTM will include: 1/ Influence the cultural transformation of the largest FSIs in India: 165 To become the innovation partner of their choice by positively influencing their culture, we will invest in long term executive 166 relationships with CXOs (aligning exec sponsors from AWS), leverage CXO engagement mechanisms such as COI/WB to help them 167

Our investment in CSMs coupled with ES will help us accelerate execution 3/ CX and Digital 172 Banking: To harness a key trend of these large Banks investing in in-house builders to esp. build CX & digital platforms, our focus 173 on T&C, Account Based Marketing & enablement (to be detailed in an account plan) will help us build skills and nurture AWS 174 champions across the breadth of their organization. 4/ Public Sector Banks: Within the PSU Bank space, we have begun to make 175 headway with the creation of a dedicated landing zone at State Bank of India (India’s largest Bank), CRMNext win(5Y/$3M) at Punjab 176 National Bank(3rd largest PSU) and Cloud transformation VMCA win at Union Bank of India($600K ARR). For 2024, unlocking PSBs 177 is a big bet, the plan for which is elaborated in our Think Big plan. 178 FSI Focus (ENT) consists of 118 accounts (child a/cs) spread across 9 territories (with 1 dedicated GRN territory with ~24 accounts) 179 with $59M TTM revenue, spread across sub-industries as 44 banking (or lending/NBFCs), 21 capital market cos, 18 insurers and rest 180 as other misc. financial services providers. The average coverage ratio in engaged territories is 1:11 in ENG and 1:24 in GRN. The 181 territories are regionally spread as Mumbai (5), Chennai (1), BLR (1) and Delhi (1) with an optimal mix of Focus core and select 182 accounts. One territory in Mumbai is predominantly focused on Capital Markets, while the rest are a mixed across sub verticals. FSI 183 Focus sales motion will help customer drive their transformation goals by 1/ Driving industry specific solutions, esp. with LOB 184 stakeholders across Digital banking, lending solutions, CX, risk management, underwriting, claims, analytics, etc. These solutions 185 will be tailored with partners (SIs/GSIs) or vertical ISVs driving a co-sell motion or migrating/upgrading solutions from on-prem to 186 cloud. 2/ Migrations and modernization will continue to be a focus to win new tactical workloads or establish a long-term cloud 187 roadmap to eventually drive DC exit opportunities; 3/ Partners: Align with specific partners (SI/GSIs –atleast 2 per customer) 188 captured in a territory plan (to be completed before Mar 1st) and driven by PSMs for proactive interlock and cadence. 4/ Marketing 189 & Innovation Programs: Leverage FS industry specific marketing programs (3rd party Industry events, ExecLeaders, FS Symposium 190 & roundtables) to drive net new contact acquisition or nurture exec relationships. To better align with cultural transformation 191 agenda of our customers, DI (both 1:1 & IXA format) will be key to help us become the preferred Innovation partner. (Appendix 7).  192 FSI Fintech business consists of 4 Deep accounts (3 from Payment and 1 from Capital Markets, with $119M TAS and $94.6M TTM 193 revenue) and the Focus cohort consists of 51 accounts (37 in Payments, 5 in Crypto, 4 Capital Markets & 5 Insurers) spread across 194 6 territories with $355M TAS and $99M TTM revenue in 2023, to be covered by 6 AMs and 5 SAs across 6 territories. 2024 Focus: 195 1/ Increase our Share of Wallet (SOW): With increased competitive activity in the last 18 months, we will continue to focus on 196 increasing our 79% share in our top 20 fintech accounts, which contribute to 86% of Fintech revenue. This year, we will target to 197 have a PPA with all Top 20 customers. We currently have 19 but 6 of them are up for renewal in 2024. (Details in Appendix 8). 2/ 198 Strengthen Executive connects: We will continue our focus to build deeper connects with our top 20 customers esp. with 199 Founder/CEO/CTO relationships through 1:1 Executive connects, AWS marketing forums for builders (Mumbai Summit, ReInvent, 200 AI Conclave etc.) and leveraging existing Marketing programs such as  the FSI Symposium. We will also leverage One Amazon 201 initiatives to drive Pan-Amazon synergies, e.g.: A.in relationships with PayU for Payment processing and Razorpay for Digital Suite 202 offerings. 3/ Operational excellence: We will complete Value maps and Account plans for top 20 customers by 15th Feb with 203 operational cadences to drive execution of the plans. Cost Optimisation will be a priority for our top customers with a goal to 204 improve the COI score from avg. of 63 to 73 by end of FY24, also increase the Graviton adoption from 8.9% to 13%. 4/ Focus on 205 next set of High Growth Accounts: We will identify the “Next 15” (from Focus) accounts & target opportunities in whitespaces. E.g. 206 Analytics/AIML opportunities in 5 of our 20 accounts that are not using AWS native services. 5 Migration prospects (PhonePe, 207 BillDesk, Paisabazaar, Wimbo, CCAvenue) and drive $3M in 2024.  208 Partner Motion: Partner attach in ENT FSI (excluding Fintechs) has grown to 75% in 2023 (vs. 70.1% in 2022). We aim to take this 209 further to 80%+ in 2024. Fintechs, who are largely builders had a partner attach of 33.2% (vs. 28% in 2022). In 2024 our partner 210 strategy will revolve around the following 4 key pillars in FSI: 1/ Proactively Partnering with GSIs to drive transformational 211 outcomes: Our engagement with GSIs has grown significantly (over 70% YoY) in 2023 for 3 out of top 5 GSIs. Overall GSI pipeline 212 grew over 137% YoY to $21.89M, reflecting both GSI interest, AWS Sellers engaging partners pro-actively and the preference from 213 customers in transformational opportunities. Some large transformational projects with GSIs in 2023 included HDFC Bank (Deloitte 214 cloud consulting), Bajaj Finserv Group (TCS), Equitas Bank (IBM, digital banking build). PSMs will own and drive Partner plans with 215 proactive interlock with key GSIs (at least 1 incumbent and 1 challenger GSI in every ENT deep and 20% of ENT Focus accounts by 216 end Q1; drive interlock with at least 1 BCAP per Deep account in H1). 2/ SI Partners for migrations & modernization: Key SI and 217 regional consulting Partners provide us scale and execution capabilities for migration & modernization with many also bringing in 218 FSI expertise on applications, process knowhow or security/regulatory compliance capabilities. We will identify 7 priority SI partners 219 (WIP: CXIO, Rackspace, ACC, Lumiq, Quadra, Ganit, Oneture) with who we will drive maximum proactive sales interlocks as well as 220 maximise 1:1 FS LT connect + cadence to build traction for better coverage. 3/ FSI ISV Partners: FSI ISV partners continue to be the 221 backbone of ENT FSIs in India, this motion elaborated in the FSI IGA section. We will also be working closely with 1/2 partners (like 222 TCS) on our Think Big opportunity to enable a DC Exit at large banks, which will require a multi-year transformational approach. 223 JAN 2024 | FY23 OP2 – FSI 
Amazon Confidential  Page 5 of 12 3.2 FSI Industry Solutions IGA Update:  224 FSI Industry solutions IGA objectives: 1/ Identify, Cultivate and Enable FSI ISVs to build cloud enabled Industry Solutions on AWS, 225 and 2/ Joint GTM of these Industry Solutions to drive value to ISV and FSI customers. 226 2023 performance vs. plan: Attainment in 2023 of $1.3M (60%). Gap in attainment due to: 1/ HDFC-CRMNext ($3M ARR) moving 227 to 2024, 2/ HDFC-Mindgate deferment ($1.7M ARR), 3/ ICICI Bank-Intellect Design moving to 2024 ($600K ARR), 4/ PNB-CRMNext 228 moving to 2024 ($600K ARR). These will provide a fast start for 2024. Another learning is the time required to align an ISV. It takes 229 3-5 months and FSI sales cycle is longer (4-6 months). Ramp time for revenue is longer than anticipated. IGA has strengthened our 230 Industry Solutions messaging to customers by bringing the entire gamut of FSI relevant partner products mapped to FSI application 231 landscape. During 2023, IGA team identified 90 ISVs, targeted 55 and connected 45 ISVs across 25+ areas (Appendix 9). Enabled 232 field teams with 14 Path’shala’ sessions, 50+ SA sessions and Joint GTM. This translated into 137 opportunities created across 67 233 unique FSI customers and 56 opportunities launched with ARR value of $4M. Key launched opportunities include CRMNext-Axis 234 Bank, Mindgate-Yes Bank, Pennant-Piramal Finance, Pennant-Avanse Finance, Decimal-AU SFB and Intellect-IDFC First. 235 2024 goals and execution plan: With Dec’23 exit MRR at $297K, we will reach an aggregate $4.9M from beginning till ’24 end. Will 236 need incremental $3.2M to meet the overall 3Y IGA target. Execution Plan to meet this: 1/ Pipeline of $7.4M in place with $1.7M in 237 Bus Val + Tech Val + Committed stage, 2/ We will execute a fast start program to accelerate closure of the opportunities in pipeline: 238 HDFC-CRMNext (first year ARR of $800K), HDFC-Mindgate (ARR $1.7M), Axis Bank-TSYS (ARR $960K), IDFC-Montran ($400K), 3/ We 239 now observe a pattern of deal replication which will support non-linear growth during 2024 e.g. CRMNext (HDFC, Axis, SBI, Canara, 240 PNB, Muthoot, JK Bank), Pennant (Piramal, Avanse, HDFC, Axis Finance, UNO Bank, Unity SFB, Ecofy, Vistaar), Mindgate (HDFC, Yes 241 Bank, IndusInd, RBL, Kotak), Liquitics (Kotak, ICICI, IndusInd, Unity SFB, Bandhan), 4/ In 2024, we will be running with 1.5 HC (1 AM 242 and 1 SA distributed between IGA and FSI accounts). Beyond revenue, IGA has a long-term impact by 1/ gaining mindshare with 243 ISVs to recommend AWS e.g. Mindgate (aligned to Azure earlier) is now AWS-First; CRMNext quoted 4 RFPs with AWS in 2023; 244 Pennant is recommending AWS as preferred partner 2/ identifying niche AWS-ready FSI industry solutions which were out of 245 purview earlier e.g. Liquitics, Coherent Global, VirSoftech, Veefin etc. 3/ entering into industry solution conversation with FSI 246 customers. Our mission is to make this the best FSI sales team in the industry, highly competent in solution-selling to our customers. 247 3.3 Q1’24 Fast Start  248 FSI in 2024, combines ENT FSI and Fintech, will focus on: 1/Account transition plan: New account team introductions and knowledge 249 transfers to be concluded by Jan 31st. 2/ Exec Connect: In order to drive deeper strategic ties and stronger account relationship we 250 will have a connect between Segment leader/ FLM and senior stakeholders of our top 30 accounts (that drive 70% of the revenue) 251 by Q1 and reach top 45 accounts that drive 80% of the revenue by end of H1. 3/ Focus on GenAI : We will explore (5th Feb- 1st Mar) 252 and execute GenAI opportunities in our Top 25 accounts with the support of our SA team with a target to pursue 15 Qualified+ 253 Opps. 4/ Team enablement: To benefit from Industry alignment model we need to train/upskill our team with relevant industry 254 knowledge/ available sales plays. We will work with Field Enablement team and Industry BD/Specialist team to roll out training 255 calendar and enablement for the year. 5/ Partner led Sales play: a/Co sell motion: Drive programmatic (19th Feb -29th Mar) co-sell 256 by focusing on five domains (Storage, Security, Analytics). b/ SRRP Prospecting campaign with 4 identified SRRP partners (PaloAlto, 257 Zscaler, MongoDb, Trendmicro) to build a SRRP pipeline in Q1’24 ($2M creation). 6/ Industry Specific Sales Plays with ISV solutions 258 (CRMNext, Penant, Mindgate) to provide solution-based offering to our customers with a target to create $5 M pipe. 259 4.0 Think Big plan: Build an integrated $1B FSI business (5X growth) by driving deeper penetration  260 Incremental revenue potential of $250M-$300M over 3Y. With rapid digitization of key infrastructure like payments and faster 261 adoption of digital channels like eBanking and Mobile, Banks have had to innovate at a faster pace than ever before to deliver 262 differentiated customer experiences and build higher resiliency on core systems. This has led Banks to embrace technology as a 263 core tenet to drive business outcomes. This has given an opportunity to explore bold DC Exit opportunities at some large banks to 264 drive deeper penetration in FSI ($200M+ ARR, $2.6B TAS across segments). FSI can be an engine of growth for India. While we will 265 continue to engage early to build cloud native solutions with Fintechs, the GTM plan for ENT FSI customers will involve a 4-pronged 266 approach focused on the highest TAS opportunities to build a $1B FSI business. 1/ Data Center (DC) exit program: Currently, only 267 about 10% of core banking/insurance workloads are on the cloud, and targeted DC exits are crucial to increase adoption. We will 268 focus on the top 16 FSI customers across banking (e.g. HDFC, ICICI, SBI, Axis, Yes Bank) & insurance (e.g. Max Life, BAGIC/BALIC, 269 ICICI Prudential Life), and target to win 60% of TAS/$100M+ ARR each, over the next 3Y-5Y (regulatory guidelines mandate a multi-270 cloud approach, thereby limiting penetration). This approach will require sustained CEO level executive engagements, tight 271 #OneAWS execution, & customized incentive programs to build early traction. We will also need to invest in a Business Development 272 team that has experience driving such large-scale DC Exits, including crafting the ideal commercial construct. 2/ Partner with leading 273 ISVs & GSIs to modernize & deploy FSI SaaS solutions: Currently, almost all traditional ENT FSIs leverage core banking applications 274 from GSIs/ISVs (e.g. TCS BaNCS, Infosys/ Finacle, Oracle FlexCube, GroupAsia & LifeAsia from DXC), but these solutions are 275 predominantly on-prem and are heavily dependent on an Oracle stack. This presents an opportunity to migrate & modernize these 276 applications (with support from our WW service teams), while engaging with the FSIs to deploy them, and will require a cohesive, 277 tripartite GTM approach between the ISV/GSIs, the banks and AWS. 3/ Continue engaging with regulators and strengthen AWS’ 278 role in “Make in India”. In addition to focused regulatory engagement to ensure cloud adoption by FSIs is viewed favourably by the 279 JAN 2024 | FY23 OP2 – FSI 
Amazon Confidential  Page 6 of 12 regulators, we need to build evidence for AWS’ role in the “Make in India” narrative beyond having local data centers (e.g., MSFT-280 Jio, OCI-Airtel), given the focus on self-reliance and an India Cloud. The Indian government is actively considering its options for a 281 “sovereign cloud”, to have more strategic control over cloud providers providing infrastructure to public sector and regulated 282 industries. Partnering with a reputed conglomerate like TATA Sons to build such an “India Cloud” offering will be crucial to ensure 283 AWS continues to be a player in the Indian FS industry. [Ask]:1/  Investment in a senior project management headcount to build 284 and manage an execution plan, including driving partner conversations, in collaboration with the PSM and GSI teams.2/ AWS WW 285 and APJ leadership commitment to drive regular (twice a year, once the project is conceptualized) interactions with CEOs of at least 286 4 banks (SBI, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank). A T2T2T (that includes partner CEO connect) will be crucial to accelerate such a 287 bold initiative in India, where cloud adoption in Banking is still very nascent.3/ A strategic partnership with a conglomerate like 288 TATA sons, to drive India Cloud offerings. 4/ Drive momentum in Public Sector Banks ($700M TAS): India has 10 Public sector Banks 289 (PSB) who contribute to 48% of the Retail-MSME credit market in India. Out of these, 6 PSBs will covered as Deep accounts (2 290 engaged – SBI, Canara; and 4 GF – BOB, PNB, BOI, UBI). The PSBs are publicly listed for-profit commercial organizations, but with 291 government shareholding, have unique organization structures (most top execs have a lifetime tenure at PSBs), complex & 292 consensus driven decision-making processes (via strictly defined RFP processes) and have traditionally been slow to adopt any new 293 technology compared to Private sector Banks in India (we est. a 18-24 months lag in tech adoption). However, with Private Banks 294 on a firm journey to public cloud adoption with material workloads, we have seen early signs of interest from PSBs to get started. 295 We will drive momentum in this sector to deliver ~4M in 2024 and $60M over 5 years. A detailed write-up on PSB is in Appendix 6. 296 5.0 Summary of key risks, dependencies and asks (beyond the asks for Big Bets): 297 1/ Constant Currency offerings for 5 years. As evidenced in the conversations with CAMS, HDFC Life (and it is expected to be an ask 298 by Public Sector Banks, as we make inroads), a 5-year INR pricing commercial construct is increasingly becoming critical to win in 299 India. 2/ In order to drive more revenue, expedite availability of MP and other strategic services (like Gen AI) in India. 3/ Competitive 300 ProServe pricing (as compared to other CSPs and large GSIs) will become a key requirement to move business critical workloads to 301 AWS at large FSIs. Indian FSIs, who are yet to become proficient builders, frequently require OEM skin in the game for mission 302 critical projects. Anecdotal feedback suggests we can be up to 2x competition currently, which is not scalable. This will also be 303 critical to win more standalone ProServe opportunities vs relying too heavily on PPA Attach. ProServe should also have the same 304 funding levers that are available for partners, to ensure parity 4/ Marketing: (a) Adequate funding for in-account initiatives for Deep 305 and some Focus-Select accounts.(b) An in-person FSI Forum for the top 25-30 FSI (across Enterprise and Fintech) stakeholders, to 306 enable networking, share learnings, deepen CXO connects and showcase our large transformation successes. 5/ Incremental 307 headcount: (a)  Specialist BD/SA pod for Gen AI and 1 Specialist BD/SA pod for Data/ Analytics, dedicated to FSI.(b) Incremental SA 308 coverage of 8 SAs (3 for Deep, 3 for Fintech, 1 for Focus and 1 for FSI ISV) to ensure adequate coverage (c) Dedicated program 309 manager to support FSI initiatives. 6/ Increased CSM coverage for all MAP 2.0 across Deep and Focus; CSM for every Deep account 310 billing more than $5M ARR. 7/ SSOE support to operationalize revenue sharing across FSI and ISV/SUP teams to drive better 311 collaboration between the teams. 8/ A specific comp for Public sector Banks in Deep Sales motion. These banks will take 2-3 years 312 to ramp-up owing to the slow bureaucratic processes in these organizations. Requesting a 2-3 year sales plan for AMs covering 313 Banks like SBI, Canara Bank, that are no longer in Greenfield as group entities are billing with AWS. Greenfield tag is assessed at the 314 parent level, leading to these 0 biller banks to not be eligible for a Greenfield compensation plan. 9/ TAS data used for segmentation 315 has data errors (e.g. IndusInd Bank, the 5th largest private sector bank, is shown with $11M TAS, while its microfinance subsidiary, 316 Bharat Financial, is show to have $29M TAS). Inaccuracies in TAS data has led to 2 large accounts moving to Scale (e.g. Indian 317 Overseas Bank, Indian Bank are among the top 10 Public sector banks in the country). Request for a window to correct these errors 318 for some obvious accounts. 319 6.0 Conclusion: 320 2023 was a challenging year for FSI. There have been multiple headwinds like intense focus on CO (over 50% of customers), loss of 321 a large account like Dhani (introduced a gap of $3.2M), Zscaler claw back of $3.8M (Full year) and some significant disruptive events 322 in the Fintech segment (covered earlier in the doc). However, there are significant tailwinds and FSI continues to be in a position to 323 drive good growth, if some big bets materialize and some of the regulatory and policy uncertainties are solved for. We also expect 324 a resurgence of the Fintech sector in 18-24 months time, when more investments are likely to come into this sector. We strongly 325 believe we will continue to outpace the India growth rate in this segment, and can move the integrated Enterprise and Fintech 326 vertical to a 30%+ growth in the next 24 months. The team enjoys high Earn Trust with customer stakeholders across all sub-327 verticals. We will continue to be intentional about retaining that trust. Senior stakeholders from 2 large banks remarked that they 328 have never seen any other technology vendor provide such support.  329 7.0 Frequently Asked Questions 330 7.1 What “dogs not barking” worry you?  331 1/ Ambiguity around Regulatory/ Policy direction around India Cloud and the ability to host business critical workloads on US HQed 332 CSPs (NSE who have scaled down their cloud footprint). Currently, UIDAI is not approving the use of cloud for Aadhar Vault and 333 AUA/KUA services. 2/ A push by regulators to explore cloud ready and CSP agnostic solutions, potentially slowing the down the 334 JAN 2024 | FY23 OP2 – FSI 
Amazon Confidential  Page 7 of 12 adoption of our cloud native services, the core of our modernization strategy. We continue to work closely with the PP team on 335 both topics. We will need a concerted effort, in collaboration with PS teams, to address the same.  336 7.2 How are competitors innovating in your area?  337 Competitors are relying on aggressive discounts to win targeted workloads (E.g. GCP at HDFC Ergo) rather than Innovation, with the 338 exception of the OpenAI partnership of MS. Early availability of Gen AI offerings in India (E.g. Vertex AI and Open AI) have provided 339 them a head start with FSI customers, with early whitelisting. We need Bedrock availability in India in early Q1’24. We will leverage 340 the GenAI Innovation Center as a strategic tool to drive business outcomes at large customers. 341 7.3 Which industry vertical initiatives are critical for growth acceleration? What support do you need from BDSI specialists?  342 Growth in Banking, and Retention in Fintech will be key factors to drive growth in FSI. We’ll need BDSI expertise to drive 343 transformational DC exit programs. Continued support of BDSI specialists in Deep and Focus Select will be needed to drive 344 conversations with LoB leaders. BDSI support will also be needed to establish AWS as a thought leader in driving business outcomes 345 in FSI through Industry events and supporting regional and WW CxO initiatives. This is required to bring global learnings to India as 346 well as offer a platform for Indian leaders to showcase their success globally. 347 Appendices 348 Appendix 1: Overview of FSI segment split 349

Amazon Confidential  Page 9 of 12 - Database ($24.7M ARR 2023 YTD, 10% YoY), Containers ($17.5M ARR 2023 YTD, 14% YoY), Analytics ($8.67M ARR 2023 YTD, -4% 362 YoY), AI/ML ($0.61M ARR 2023 YTD, 24% YoY). Key thematic areas of our wins and losses are: a) Containers:  We are able to influence 363 our customers to adopt containers (running on Graviton chips and spot instances) as infrastructure choice to optimize costs and 364 improve utilization. E.g. Upstox migrated their order management platform on EKS with Karpenter ($0.3M YTD Nov, 74% YoY), PayU 365 launched Thought Machine - a Core Banking application on EKS ($0.42M YTD Nov, 61% YoY), CoinDCX launched their DeFi/CeFI on 366 EKS  with Karpenter ($0.6M YTD Nov, 682% YoY), Paytm migrated and re-architected their Auth application from Ali-cloud to EKS 367 ($0.8M YTD Nov, 55% YoY), Polygon re-architected their monolith applications running on EC2 to ECS utilizing Fargate ($0.63M YTD 368 Nov, 2796% YoY). b) Databases: For relational use-cases such as transactional consistency, better performance and scalability, un-369 differentiated heavy lifting of database management and DR capabilities (with Aurora), customers such as Paytm, PayU, BharatPe, 370 Upstox, Razorpay continue to scale on RDS (especially RDS Aurora), thus driving the usage. For NoSQL use-cases, ‘Key-Value pair’ 371 requirement is the most sought after and is extensively used in use-cases such as data-store for micro-services, other applications 372 which can work with eventual consistency model. For such use-cases, Dynamo DB is preferred by customers such as Paytm (Ads 373 team), PayU, CoinDCX due to its performance and serverless architecture. Besides Dynamo DB, we’re also seeing interest from 374 Fintech customers such as Polygon technology, PayU, Navi Technology, Paytm for storing JSON data as documents, thus driving up 375 the utilization of Document DB. c) Analytics: Customers such as Navi Technologies, Paytm, PayU, Slice, Polygon have continued to 376 build and scale their data pipelines using Lakehouse architecture which has driven the usage of Amazon Managed Streaming for 377 Kafka ($1.3M YTD Nov, 36% YoY), EMR ($2.2M YTD Nov, 55% YoY) and Athena ($0.55M YTD Nov, 1% YoY). Slice, a fintech major in 378 Lending business have migrated from Databricks to EMR (#winback from compete ISVs, contributing to EMR ) as EMR is able to 379 offer a better price to performance and more choices of run-times (such as Flink, Trino). Customers undertook various optimization 380 activities on their OpenSearch clusters e.g. archival/periodic maintenance of data, graviton adoption, node re-sizing which led to 381 reduction of OpenSearch usage (and hence 18% YoY drop in revenue). Redshift usage also contracted ($1.17M YTD Nov, -36% YoY) 382 as customers moved to Lakehouse architecture 383 Appendix 5: Gen AI update: 384 Across traditional FSI enterprises, 34 GenAI sessions across 23 FSI customers were conducted. These sessions were attended by 385 600+ attendees and received an avg CSAT of 4.5/5. Apart from customer sessions, 2 enablement sessions conducted for field teams 386 covering the basics of Gen AI, AWS services positioning, demos, industry use cases and partners to engage. These sessions led to 387 discussion of 22 customer uses cases across various customers across 11 FSI customers, among which 5 POCs are currently in 388 progress. Based on the POC discussions 22 customer influences for Amazon Bedrock availability in BOM region were created 389 influencing $517K. SA team has 3 GenAI ambassadors and co-owned the AWS Generative AI Hackathon Playbook . This document 390 helped the SA team conduct 14 Workshops / Hackathons (including Axis Bank) across multiple customers across India and attended 391 by 1200+ participants. Details can be found in https://quip-amazon.com/ZgCoAatZU0yb/AWS-Generative-AI-Hackathon-Playbook-392 for-ENT. There has been executive engagement with service teams at Axis Bank (Bedrock, Kendra & Plato), HDFC Bank (Gen AI 393 focussed EBC), BFL (Gen AI focussed EBC). This has led to PoCs at all these customers, Axis Bank PoC is in progress & at other 394 customers in discussion.  395 Enterprise Wins - From customer adoption of AWS GenAI services, GaadiBazaar (NLP powered query) is in CUG, MaxLife 396 (conversational bot for agents) has been rolled out to be used by 1000 support agents (Winner in AI Conclave) and ICICI Lombard 397 has deployed 2 uses case (Chatbots) in Pre-prod.  Additionally, we have got one of our Focus customers - Fincare Small Finance 398 Bank experimenting with Claude and Titan and will go live in Q1 24 ($100k) 399 Across Fintech : Across 4 deep accounts (Paytm, Quadeye Securities, Razorpay, Cred) - we’ve done 10+ sessions with these 400 customers covering technical topics such as Sagemaker Jumpstart, CodeWhisperer, Bedrock, recently launched services Amazon Q, 401 QuickSight Q (done at Paytm only) resulting in a) Paytm evaluating Sagemaker Jumpstart, Bedrock for use-cases such as 402 Personalised QR generation, document Q&A to improve the productivity of operations team and            Code Whisperer b) Razorpay 403 has successfully completed a PoC of Amazon Bedrock (using Claude V2) to build a merchant assistance bot which will replace a 404 similar bot built with OpenAI. Razorpay is moving out of OpenAI due to better pricing of ClaudeV2 when compared to OpenAI. 405 Razorpay is also evaluating Amazon              Bedrock (Claude) vs OpenAI to create an automated data-dictionary for Data-406 warehousing tables. c) Happay, part of Cred, is evaluating Amazon Bedrock (Claude V2) to build an expense management 407 application. We’ve partnered with WWSO team to drive these GenAI engagements which included activities such as - customer 408 leadership engagement to create mindshare on AWS services, in-account developer engagement thru GenAI hackathons 409 (conducted in 1 each at Paytm and Razorpay), customer enablement, support in technical evaluation of AWS GenAI services and 410 engagement with WW GenAI team. Thru our activities in these accounts, we’ve been able to secure the sponsorship of key customer 411 stakeholders such as CTO, Head of Data Science.  412 Fintech Wins: Our activities in 2023 has resulted in 2 GenAI launches at Paytm. a) Launch of personalised QR code in Paytm app 413 using Stable Diffusion to celebrate Indian Independence Day (ARR $60K) b) Rent agreement analysis using Textract, Sagemaker 414 Jumpstart (Cohere Generate Model - Command) for text summarization, Q&A (ARR $66K).  415 JAN 2024 | FY23 OP2 – FSI 
Amazon Confidential  Page 10 of 12 Challenges/Learnings: a) To comply with data residency requirements, fintech customers are seeking Bedrock availability in BOM 416 region. Additionally, for Bedrock BOM region launch we would need feature parity with N. Virginia region viz. Agents, Knowledge 417 Base as customers like Paytm are seeking these features (PFR link from Paytm account)  b) Prompt engineering in Bedrock is 418 verbose when compared with OpenAI e.g. in situations wherein calculations need to be done, OpenAI can invoke external agents 419 seamlessly without end users doing prompt engineering (such as agents and tools). Customer developers have also mentioned to 420 us that with OpenAI, there is a plethora of tutorials/online guides available. Claude has limited amount of prompt engineering 421 (and other help guides) available and at times this has become a blocker during evaluation stages c) For certain use-cases, we’ve 422 found that OpenAI is able to provide better prediction accuracy when compared with Bedrock e.g. at Razorpay for multi-lingual 423 Auto-eKYC use-case, OpenAI was found to provide a better prediction accuracy when compared to Claude on Amazon Bedrock d) 424 We’ve not been successful in helping our customer adopt Code Whisperer in compete against Github Co-pilot. Feedbacks 425 received – 1/ The number of English words needed by CodeWhisperer to  generate working code sample is verbose when 426 compared to Github Co-pilot  2/ Code Whisperer had been un-able to scan existing code repositories thereby   limiting the 427 developers’ ability to use in daily situations. In FY24, we will re-engage our customers on Code Whisperer basis of the reinvent 428 launches. 429 Appendix 6: Think Big for Public Sector Banks: 430 Plan for 2024: India has 10 Public sector Banks (PSB) who contribute to 48% of the Retail-MSME credit market in India. Out of these, 431 6 PSBs will covered as Deep accounts (2 engaged – SBI, Canara; and 4 GF – BOB, PNB, BOI, UBI), with a combined estimated TAS of 432 ~$900M. The PSBs are publicly listed for-profit commercial organizations, but with government shareholding, have unique 433 organization structures (most top execs have a lifetime tenure at PSBs), complex & consensus driven decision-making processes 434 (via strictly defined RFP processes) and have traditionally been slow to adopt any new technology compared to Private sector Banks 435 in India (we est. a 18-24 months lag in tech adoption). However, with Private Banks on a firm journey to public cloud adoption with 436 material workloads, we have seen early signs of interest from PSBs to get started. Some key beachheads, we currently have in PSBs 437 include Co-lending platform at SBI (Yubi), Canara (SFDC SRRP win via RFP), PNB (CRMNext win, $3M/5Y), UBI (VMCA for T&D, $650K 438 ARR committed stage), Central Bank Housing Finance ($200K ARR), SBI GIC ($3.6M/3Y PPA), Canara HSBC ($200K ARR), etc. To put 439 them on a firm path to AWS cloud, we will drive the following key initiatives in 2024: 1/ Building a security & compliance foundation: 440 In 2024, we will focus on building a strong security & compliance foundation helping build awareness across security and other 441 teams, and help them better understand the operational controls needed on AWS to meet their regulatory needs. This should 442 culminate in building a landing zone across these Banks. Landing zone plans have already been kickstarted at SBI with discussions 443 in progress at PNB and UBI; 2/ Building executive sponsorship for Cloud adoption: by engaging CIOs and Executive Directors (EDs 444 are function heads who report into MDs) to build mindshare drive specific call-to-actions of identifying the first set of workloads to 445 be migrated 3/ Joint account planning with key ISVs: Work on joint account planning with key strategic ISVs such as CRMNext, SFDC, 446 Nucleus, Lentra, Newgen, Finacle, Mindgate, TCS Bancs, Workapps, etc. E.g.: This has helped us identify opportunities in SBI, PNB, 447 Canara, etc. with two key wins (with CRMNext at PNB, $3M/5yr; and SFDC at Canara Bank) 4/ Align with incumbent and challenger 448 GSIs/Large SI partners (atleast 2 per account): All PSBs have major GSIs as their outsourcing partners. PSBs typically award end-to-449 end RFPs for specific applications/initiatives on a turnkey basis for 5/ 7 years including implementation and managed services to an 450 SI/GSIs. Early alignment will help us engage/identify early Pre-RFP stage opportunities. 6/ Skilling and enablement: Given their low 451 Cloud awareness levels, we will work to drive both broad based and executive skilling and enablement initiatives across these 452 accounts including leveraging marketing (ABM). 7/ Focus on Banking Subsidiaries for In-year growth: PSBs have Insurance, cards, 453 securities, NBFC or wealth mgmt. subsidiaries who generally have more autonomy in decision making (relative to the Parent Bank) 454 due to their governance structure and smaller size. Some subsidiaries such as Canara HSBC, SBI GIC, etc. have already started on 455 Cloud/AWS with key applications, giving us an opportunity to accelerate them in 2024. Tactically, the above key initiatives will be 456 captured in an account plan collaborating with extended teams to drive our alignment and focus. We will also engage external 457 influencers and bodies such as IBA (Indian Banking Association, which is dominated by PSB members) to drive thought leadership 458 (E.g.: participating in industry events such as IBA Awards & pursue joint publishing of whitepapers) or one-to-many 459 initiatives/workshops on Cloud transformation.
